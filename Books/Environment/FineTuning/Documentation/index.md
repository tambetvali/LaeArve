# Preparing documentation for Fine-Tuning

I don't list all these tools separately here, but within one post.

My Choices:
I think I gonna try __Haystack__.

To upload an entire documentation tree and get back a structured dataset of cards for fine-tuning, you can use tools and frameworks that support hierarchical data processing and structured output. Here's how you can achieve this:

## Frameworks for Tree-Based Processing

### 1. LangChain:
- LangChain allows you to process entire directories of files and create structured datasets. You can use its document loaders to traverse your documentation tree and output structured data.
- Example:
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load entire directory
loader = DirectoryLoader("path/to/docs", glob="**/*.*")
docs = loader.load()

# Split into structured cards
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
structured_cards = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

# Output structured dataset
for card in structured_cards:
    print(card.metadata, card.page_content)
```

### 2. Haystack:
- Haystack supports hierarchical document processing and can create structured datasets for fine-tuning.
- Example:
```python
from haystack.document_stores import InMemoryDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import TextConverter

# Load entire directory
document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()
converter = TextConverter()
docs = converter.convert_directory("path/to/docs")

# Store structured cards
document_store.write_documents(docs)
```

### 3. Hugging Face Datasets:
- Hugging Face Datasets can process hierarchical data and output structured datasets for fine-tuning.
- Example:
```python
from datasets import Dataset

# Load entire directory
def load_docs(directory):
    data = []
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            with open(os.path.join(root, file), "r") as f:
                data.append({"path": file, "content": f.read()})
    return data

docs = load_docs("path/to/docs")
dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"cards": docs})
```

## Output Structured Cards
Once you've processed the documentation tree, you can structure the output as cards. Each card can represent a chunk of text with metadata (e.g., file path, section title, etc.). This structured dataset can then be used directly for fine-tuning.

## Free Hosting and Processing
If you want to host this process for free:
- Use __Google Colab__ for running the scripts.
- Deploy the processing pipeline on __Render__ or __PythonAnywhere__.

These tools will help you upload your entire documentation tree, process it, and output a structured dataset of cards for fine-tuning. Let me know if you'd like help setting up any of these! ðŸš€

### Frameworks for Preprocessing Documentation Trees

1. **LangChain**  
LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by language models. It supports document loaders for PDFs, HTML, Markdown, and code files. You can use LangChain to parse and preprocess your documentation tree into a format suitable for fine-tuning.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, UnstructuredHTMLLoader, TextLoader

# Load PDFs
pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader("example.pdf")
pdf_docs = pdf_loader.load()

# Load HTML
html_loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader("example.html")
html_docs = html_loader.load()

# Combine and preprocess
all_docs = pdf_docs + html_docs
```

2. **Hugging Face Datasets**  
Hugging Face Datasets is a library for creating and managing datasets. It supports loading and processing various file formats like Markdown, JSON, and plain text. You can structure your documentation tree into a dataset and use it directly for fine-tuning.  

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files={"train": "docs/*.md"})
```

3. **Unstructured.io**  
Unstructured.io provides tools for parsing and preprocessing unstructured data, including PDFs, HTML, and Markdown. It extracts clean text from your documentation files, making them ready for fine-tuning workflows.  

```python
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

elements = partition_pdf("example.pdf")
text = "\n".join([str(el) for el in elements])
```

4. **Haystack**  
Haystack is an open-source framework for building search systems and question-answering pipelines. It supports document preprocessing for various formats like PDFs, HTML, Markdown, and text.  

```python
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

elements = partition_pdf("example.pdf")
text = "\n".join([str(el) for el in elements])
```

5. **Custom Scripts**  
For a lightweight approach, you can write Python scripts to traverse your documentation tree and preprocess files. This allows for flexibility in handling custom formats and structures.  

```python
import os

def load_docs(directory):
    docs = []
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith((".md", ".html", ".pdf")):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file), "r") as f:
                    docs.append(f.read())
    return docs

docs = load_docs("path/to/docs")
```

### Structured Output for Fine-Tuning  
Once processed, the output can be formatted as structured cards. Each card can represent a chunk of text, metadata, and other contextual information. The dataset can be used directly for fine-tuning tasks with language models.

### Hosting and Interactivity  
To host this process for free:
- Use **Google Colab** to run the preprocessing pipeline.
- Deploy it on platforms like **Render** or **PythonAnywhere** for ongoing interactivity.
