# Laegna Algorithmic Programming Language

Laegna Language implements __Algorithmic__: subset of the Imperative Language Class; which we call Laegma Imperativelanguage Class (let's support initializer "Class" also _after_ the initial title of multiword, but with CamelCase and camelCase composers, with Accronyms allowed randomly, non-linearly and hypothetically or poetically, to allow the Languages in __Games__ and __Stoory Narrative Animations__ (by which I really define what _Game_ is), ); as I can see the future and cannot write everything backwards, what happens in the future: _future_ of your _classes_, _functions_ and _determinants_ determine the future of your programming language, as long as it's implemented, and the __`Y`__ value or solution to it's initial problem __`(Y => Z)`__. You can use "\_\_" and "\_" as tags, if you want to do non-structured implementation, because it's an AI decision what is a structured implementation: each __AI__ _cannot_ read each _level_, _scope_, _layer_ or level of magnitude (the frequency in Laegnan, or requency in it's Meta or Reta - time-shifting Metalogeds, suitable also for _oracle systems_ or _theoretical abstract determinants_ and their _solution instances_). Alan Turing initialized the use of abstract "oracle systems" into programming theory, where one can prove the abstract properties on an oracle system, capable, in my terms, into turning Infinite Oscollations into Real Value Numbers, which we add to "higher frequency" set: we define the radius r on infinite cyrcle r if the ball would seem locally fat given the Frequential Window; the coordinate system is not absolutely continuous: closest points are said to meet, and the ideal number is 4 letters with positions I, O, A and E, where first two can be hyperposition into future, especially if written as Í and Ó, where Ó itself weakly maps to infinity of E - but neither has that infinity accelerated over OA here, where O => A iterator would pass this little non-zero there, and also allow the acceptance of zero, where we need it as line conponent growth factor has to do something, what happens between AND and OR in Fuzzy System Implementation, where tangent-like structure composed on component average have to do something equal to straight-line mapping to infinity in Logecs dimension - vs. it's Mathematecs, which is simpler to imagine. Where we detect infinite cycles, which have _positive karma_: that is, evolutionary fit and natural resistence -, it would be able to work even on potential field as the logic guiding it's future, and the sinus oscillation on it's scale, give it a _Cause_, a _reason_, and then some suitable _mission_ - some orientative direction of é-karma, the "Position Karma" in __Laegnan__.

__One "\_"__: Indicates that you __link to that subject__: (which for Laegna is defined now) Link is defined as the paragraph followed to the beginning of a header paragraph now hidden into headers, visible as it's _term_ where the paragraph itself is now _explanation_; in middle of paragraph it takes what is following to it, removing the parent-sentence linguistically, semantically needed constructs, but integrating the grammatic constructs into a solid flow; this is the definition also to what the __Language__ does. So the one sentence after the link, in my case parent sentence needs braces "(" and ")" to have a definition identifier for a metadata, which could be read by even smarter AI or it's smarter _Controller_
* In AI Database what happens:
    * While _italic_, where we prefer _i_ tags in rendering to html, to denote rather personal style or something one cannot express, where the tag uses a style element "i" and as Laegna goes throught words "__straight forward__", executing little logex machines or logecs ponegates or symbols, archetypes and particulars (XYZ, an ideal order or Laegna Latin order - Rome could sometimes sound like Catholic for a moment, in a sense that it supports such direct objectives when talking about Metaphysics); if the tag is emotional or structural [e]motion, where time is resistance of space and time, and in mathematical relations happens unknown truth hidden into how it can be, the solution. For example, multiplication and plus were originally combinated in real world; where division and minus are it's successors in imaginary realm - with upwards accent, we would resolve _minus_ into infinity, in order, where it gives particular numbers into negative array in that space; where we actually resolve the grid on number system until a particular number, and also see the beginning of the next octave, next vibration, where the _`U`_ now mapped to _`V`_ would be positioned. "\_\_" and "\_\_" (notize frequential "fuzzy" ponegate, which uses two frequencies +0 and +1, where in Laegna like in float number you rather write +0, -0, and use digit-wide imaginary frequency shift called "frequency" to contain the next number digit; lets allow linear infinite number to contain Ten numbers `[``I``, ``O``, ``A``, ``E``]` letter variables from `Python code before`, where Markdown cannot undefine the use of \`\` for nested code block needed for Laegna's purpose of mapping higher frequencies; and empty digits are randomly allowed where the circuit float number component does not execute for those values; we map the frequencies to remove math 4 operation we could call Math Ten while assuming `r`=`1` for `Ten`, ) combine
    * While _bold_, where two of asterisks or underscores mean either your emphasis on literal word, if asterisk is used - in Laegnan, if also means full-frequency number, which becomes linarly complete in downer octave (I use the word "downer" for next-octave-down in this expression form); asterisk thos expands to infinity being full of R; where two underscores means to AI used together with ":" to create item or alternative in dictionary, tree based on books, libraries (, chapters) and examples, where you can remove the "chapter" component and libraries go linearly, utilizing the package prefix with one dot and internal "version-number"-like expression, where domain is at uposition - the case that it's unknown is in the position, the variable is free to be defined otherwhere.

### Headers of Chapters

- Headers of Chapters are nested in the same order, where the titles must be either unique or ; in direction Z (where direction Z scope &R, where we want to change R; some _variables_ can be applied as index of change, for example having an attribute "set" which turns the dictionary item into member of set, and "list", which would displace it _after_ the preceding, _before_ the following elements of target where it's mapped; mapping happens in braces: calling lstdct1(lstdct2); by the way )
