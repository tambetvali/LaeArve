# ðŸ‘¾ Zero

In Laegna we have U, and it's often considered to cover half of A and half of O, being their probability function (50% both). In half octaves down, it's the actual, kind of unknown - as it must be measured in lower frequency, where frequency has scale in time and space: in time, lower frequency is _worse_ or not Position, whereas in Space it's only _smaller_, as those relations do not have the Truth Value.

V is the value of difference, when you remove U. It's written as upside-down U, and it's the opposite of U; the same way as I and E appear, as you remove O and A values, V appears as you remove U: it's it's outwards opposite and there, creates a frequential degree; thus, 0 has two values. The other value perfectly maps to infinity: we need to approach a point _outwards_, getting a single point, which does not have some posigonal value, even in accelerated or superaccelerated spaces: we never write the last digit, we never close this value, but we remain philosophical.
