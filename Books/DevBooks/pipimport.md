# Pip & import dependencies

Our Project has the following dependencies:
- Python: The main programming language
- Flask: The web server interface

- Mistune: Markdown library and HTML generator
- Jinja2: General template engine, also used by Flask

Choice of libraries:
- Small number of libraries, which would turn our problems into almost trivial. We create more problems.

- Math libraries
  - Mdmath: we use it for _large floats_. We can work with very large and very small floating point numbers.
  - NumPy: mathematical operations.

We will use:
- PyTorch: our choice over TensorFlow (more backwards-compatible, compatible with it's books and manuals)
- Access to GitHub version control and it's issue tracker, other version control systems and issue trackers, also to teach our AI's how the issues are tracked.

We are using VSCode-compatible editors, Linux systems and AIs.

# Second Document: Dreams and Ideas.

TODREAM: Then, as I work on implementation in Python, whoever is going to _port_ to GoLang and Julia, is doing good work.

Optional language dependencies:
- Julia: Just in case.
- Go: Just in case.

Python is a general-purpose scripting language with elegance over speed, strong support for AI including speed (accelerated libraries).

You can install Julia just in case: we treat it as a powerful math language. It has what programmer needs, and as such comes very close to mathematics; while there are dedicated math tools. _Mathematical Programming_ will be achieved in Julia over time: a dynamic language, yet blazingly fast, we need to incorporate the idea of using it.

Go is the low-level language of our mentality, and to implement Laegna math at low level: do it in Go.

# Third Document: You could have

What is supported by me:
- Provers: Isabelle, Coq
- Logic: Prolog
