### **What is EasyLM?**

**EasyLM** is an open-source framework built using JAX/Flax, designed to streamline the workflow for pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluating, and serving large language models (LLMs). It reduces the complexities of distributed training while offering modular configurations and scalability for researchers.

#### **Key Features of EasyLM**:
- **Simple Integration**: EasyLM provides ready-made tools for integrating with models like LLaMA, OpenLLaMA, and Koala.
- **Scalability**: Leverages JAX/Flax's ability to efficiently scale across multiple TPU/GPU accelerators.
- **Extensibility**: Offers flexibility for customizing training and evaluation pipelines.

Whether you're working on NLP, code generation, or other LLM-driven tasks, EasyLM is a great option for researchers who want to handle everything from data preparation to inference in a single framework.

### **Can EasyLM Export Models to GGUF and llama.cpp Formats?**

At the moment, EasyLM does not natively support exporting to GGUF (used by `llama.cpp`). However, there are external tools and workflows you can use to convert the fine-tuned results into the desired formats:

1. **GGUF Conversion**:
   - Use tools like the conversion scripts available in `llama.cpp` to quantize and export the models to GGUF.
   - Merge LoRA adapters or other fine-tuning layers before converting.

2. **llama.cpp Export**:
   - Similar workflows apply for `llama.cpp`. Use provided Python scripts or libraries to convert fine-tuned models into formats optimized for memory-efficient inference.

While EasyLM focuses primarily on JAX workflows, combining it with these tools can offer a complete pipeline for fine-tuning and deployment.

### **Downloading a GPT Model and Weights (OpenLLaMA)**

For those seeking completely free, static links to pre-trained GPT models, **OpenLLaMA** is an excellent choice. Hosted on GitHub, this model is open-source and includes files explicitly designed for EasyLM.

#### **Steps to Download OpenLLaMA and JAX Weights**:
1. Visit the official OpenLLaMA repository: [GitHub - OpenLLaMA](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama).
2. Look for the section mentioning "JAX weights for EasyLM." As of now, this provides static links to the required weights.
3. Direct Download Example:
   - **Base Model (7B)**: [JAX Weights Link](https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_7b_open-instruct/tarball/main) *(Verify static link stability based on repository updates).*
4. Download the weights and ensure they are placed in your desired directory for EasyLM integration.

By following these steps, you have all the files needed for training or fine-tuning with EasyLM.

### **Story of Training GPT Models with EasyLM**

Letâ€™s dive into a practical narrative of training the **OpenLLaMA** model using EasyLM.

#### **Setting the Scene**
Imagine you're a data scientist at an organization looking to create a domain-specific GPT model for summarizing research articles. OpenLLaMA catches your eye due to its open-source nature and compatibility with EasyLM.

#### **Steps in the Process**:
1. **Setting Up EasyLM**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/young-geng/EasyLM.git
     cd EasyLM
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Downloading OpenLLaMA Weights**:
   - Download the model weights from the provided JAX weights link.
   - Extract them into a directory (e.g., `models/open_llama_7b`).

3. **Fine-Tuning with Domain Data**:
   - Prepare your dataset (e.g., a collection of research articles in `.jsonl` format).
   - Start the fine-tuning process:
     ```bash
     python3 train.py \
       --model_dir=models/open_llama_7b \
       --data_dir=data/research_articles \
       --output_dir=output/fine_tuned_model
     ```

4. **Evaluating the Fine-Tuned Model**:
   - Use EasyLM's evaluation script to test the model on your specific task:
     ```bash
     python3 evaluate.py \
       --model_dir=output/fine_tuned_model \
       --task=summarization
     ```

5. **Exporting the Fine-Tuned Model**:
   - Save the fine-tuned model for deployment.
   - (Optional) Use an external conversion script for GGUF or `llama.cpp` compatibility.
