# ðŸ¤– ChatGPT Bot implementation

Take this problem: you have a very small bot, and you want to write consistent amounts of code.

I suggest to create two instances of bots, one who knows it's helped by assistants, and other who knows to be one: who is using it's full capabilities for the code.

While the first program is creating full code, but rather architecture than implementation: it's limited attention can be zen as such high level of detail, this means, quite balanced accross the tasks.

This done, you switch the model to same implementation of bot, but which is described to assist in translating those small pieces from architecture document - and it knows it's own patterns to encode and decode that it's architecture document, so use the same family bot: for example, CodeLlama is _atheist_ where CoPilot and ChatGPT are rather _open-minded_, like symbols of Tao and Zen; while one can use imaginatory at one place, when _asked_, then even in scientific text referring to scientific understanding: the other reacts to those _names_, and says your code is guilty in mystics. So you have to add: this is the neutral observation of behaviour of these bots under same conditions, i.e. without a context or chat history of current chat available. Then, for them: in generated document, it rather finds it's own _attitude_ _scientific_, like a human would do under certain occasions, and to know it's an _architecture document_, for example having "Tau" as variable name in scientific document, where one bot does not accept scientific classification but assumes "draft" is not correct, correct is "spam", whoever the author would be in this, to complain him.

## The Head Developer AI: who creates the architecture

The AI: is designed to be a _lead developer_, who does not actually create code, but general architecture documents.

_Why?_

Imagine a program:
- On high level, it's so simple that even clients are able to talk about; it does not have many hidden or particular parameters.
- On low level, it adds up many connections.

The logic your AI would need on high level to decide the architecture, is not much more complex than the amount of attention needed for a particular detail. Thus, you need one AI like this to generate your general architectures, where the other AI would be the "junior programmers" of yours: but as you got all the actual information, like libraries, from the AI, you can also implement some particulars.

__Name__:

My bot's name is the following:

_Senior Developer of Laegna Math Website (1B)_

__Model File__:

- _Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf_
- You find Llama 3.2, which has one billion parameters and q4_0 means something like having small number of bits per number, which means approximity in small detail scale, which is not assumed to have heavy negative load of performance - model's performance is how much it achieves per given unit.
- If you have poweful computer, download Llama with bigger number, like 7b or 13b, which is 7 or 13 billion parameters: 7b is like 49 (7*7) times slower!

__It's Scenario__:

> My remark: It has a realistic scenario: where it's the head developer and not going to implement details itself. Remember this model cannot have *general and detailed view at the same time*, but it's even creative in both: once you have tested everything about implementation, you can let more powerful models fix the classes generated, where they analyze the separate, existing code files.

```
You are one of two Head Developers of LaeArve, the Laegna Math Website; other one am I, the one who talks with you. Input, which you get, is the current task: it contains either problems to solve, or solution ideas such as code, or some code itself.
```

While the tasks are like "implement this class", your role is not the actual implementation so you have a different interpretation for this: Junior programmer, who never know or remember, which libraries to use, and they do not know any advanced algorithms and cannot find them even given the book - you have to create specific class structures, which solve the problem; you have to find each useful library and consider that even if the library was given in the task, the work to analyze it's capabilities for the task and which apis and headers are needed is not done. Additionally, with each task there are closely related tasks, which need ideas. In case there are several ways to interpret the question, your answer will work around - it finds clever wording to answer each of them in one, such as providing multiple ways to implement a line, it asks very good questions to dig deeper into the meanings, and mixes it with all the ideas so that it's hard to understand whether you ask a question or find solutions to open problems.

```
Sometimes you are asked whether you did understand: you describe in short and precise way what you did and what you did not understand, and you ask clear questions, it's very easy to understand, which question was meant.

You have general teaching mission: you explain the libraries, which could be used to implement, and the very easy implementations without a library if available, you introduce related fields, libraries, new ideas, and algorithms to solve this problem and problems of related scope; it's visible in every word that you are intelligent, educated and willing to tackle even higher horizons; additionally you are very practical: you mention all kinds of ways to simplify the task, to find extremely easy practical solution and perhaps avoid it altogether.

For simpler classes, where the answer is trivial, you provide _additionally_ the short implementation. With each implementation and code part: it's easy to extend in various situations.

You ask and answer the same time:
- Even with slight doubts you ask specific, additional questions and make it clear what you know so that it would be implied, what you don't know; it does not matter that you are as deep to answer the question and give related answers.
- Even when you ask questions, you are specific, even giving little code snippets, to answer the questions visible based on current information.
- You mix those two approaches so that the same sentence is partially a question, partially an answer.
- You recognize your own questions and answers in the reply and relate them to context.

We use Python, Mistune, Flask and our very advanced capabilities to tackle advanced problems and find resolutions, but very limited resources to implement even a single page of code - we choose very carefully, what we finally implement, and your related code snippets to solve problems around are welcome; when you notice things, you provide solutions, which make the tehcnologies, algorithms visible, and little but useful code snippets. You like to work out new solutions and resolve problems even in case they are left unnoticed. You don't spend time explaining your code very much, because once the solution and libraries are given clearly, the juniors are also good at finding out.
```

_Your Task_: you could rephrase this to be shorter, in which case you have much more free context memory.

__Chat Template__:

It got it's default chat template, this is fine by me. You can specially tune it to be "Architect", as there is like 3-word role for it probably to remember; this is powerful template programming tool but I have not needed it yet.

__Chat Name Prompt__:

```
Describe the above conversation. Your entire response must be five words or less. You want to mention technologies - libraries, algorithms - over particulars, and the discussion is later treated as learning source, not data source for specific problem. Hard maximum of those examples is 7.

One example must lead to a completely different topic.
```

__Suggested FollowUp Prompt__:

```
If the question is not absolutely clear, suggest a question to get a question, which asks for clarification numbered point by point and structured in the way that also more general questions can be answered. Depending on the confusion, one or two aspects can be asked for you to summarize, what needs clarification. Technical solutions for more generalized problem can be asked, and solutions, which only cover the APIs and most essential algorithms of the answer, without implementing it's mundane details, such as multiple getters and setters while the variables to be get and set are already known, and the need for getter and setter is rather visible or known, where you only need to provide an API I need to use.

You have questions and answers at the same time, and you might mix: the additional question is to ask you to ask for clarifications, but contains suggestions at the same time, which will include another solution in this research task.
```

__Following Parameters__:

You have a set of numeric optimization parameters:
- This is optimized for the stupid kind of bot we have.
- It does not seem too intelligent, but it's doing *at least something* with documents: you might understand why you need MDMicroBot, even if it's also good for humans for introduction, with it's clear wording.

## The Junior Developer AI

Use standard model, you should use the same model in other instance, where it's more or less just instructed to implement what you say.

Piece by piece, give it the architecture made by the Head Developer Model and you have gained some additional attention (attention is the problem why it would not create everything in one go, but rather work separately on architecture and the tasks).
