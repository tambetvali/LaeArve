# File Structure

Files in "history" folder are previous versions, and while containing ideas and explanations - I tackled down the complexities and reached the new, holistically simpler design of implementing my math and it's interface. History can be used to detect the mission, conceptions, additional information and graphical styles and looks; the structure and content is left very similar in structure, but the new version has much simpler implementation with much more generic view of things, so with less code it's more powerful - while the idea that there is "Json" format and corresponding link on top right is continuing, so the structure and appearance won't change, nor the conceptions, what I want to express and the book content; we have now elegant and simple concept about the implementation, and we do not take this directly from older versions. Also, the documentation in regards to function and purpose should be compact and complete in the new version, given the scope it approaches to resolve.
