# ðŸ’ƒ Laegna Fantasy

This is the first lesson of _preliminary Laegna_; we use Laegna math to convert _decimal number_ into it's _frequenctial counterpart_ of Laegna, answering two theorems; just for fun I refer to Kybalion, not it's scientific reference, but it's authentic copy of the original source with author himself, scientifically, licing in century, which was later _found biased in several senses_, including his alient encounter, "belief that there are aliens on Mars", where modern _spiritual factor_ introduces that Mars is rather an energy portal to it's dimension, _that-frequential factor_, and _that-frequential factors_ like this on Earth, like a stone representing the forest, which "made it", would not introduce a physical encounter to the forest, should you meet the stone, or to the stone, should you meet the forest; it matters, which frequency Mars is vibrating and thus also, which vitamins and poisons you are capable to find and avoid there, which is made of local material, it's light being harmonic to common-coded light sources in Reality, and evolving human will share common traits to bodies with same frequencies - most directly, frequency is made of chemical compounds, on energy and information level, which is oscillating back to it's source, so while we could find some aliens with radio - a big body made of same material with the radio, with similar connections, would be inclined to make that connection _naturally_, for example using information capacity and doing a quantum leap even on quantum and atom level, where there is still the _information_ and resulting complexities of harmonics and disharmonics between the radioactive wave reflector and the material vibrations around, producing harmonic, but in terms of energy efficiency, also informative vibrations in that sense, especially with bodies of the same source, where the _material_ is _melted to other material_:
- __Theorem of Polarity__: Synchronize both frequencies, minus and plus, into the same direction.
- __Theorem of Frequencies__: Number, by obvious vision, contains multiple subfrequencies (lower octaves f) and Frequencies in Infinity (higer Octaves F or multipliers of R, the Space Element; whether H is rather the crown chakra of Human: Infinity in relation to plus and minus in signed, or lower and higher in case of unsigned infinity, where you notice the case of complexity of writing the infinite numbers if your digit size is 2 or 4 to subsequent relation, and if you actually use the same number of digits as the numeric position in relation to it's numeric space, notice that it's still _impossible_ to write a number in both with equal capability of finding this number; you use Laegna complexHK and decimal18 conversion from vertical to horizontal freqency, mapping which _base_ you are using: in Laegna, the _bases_ are free digitwise, numberwise and complexwise, where you use multiple numbers separated by spaces - each case you have the proper mathematical conversions). This, thus, is Laegna analog in Base 10, where the mappings might seem improper and mathematically I want to see the whole theorem, so I don't optimize: this is optimized simply to assumption that we use decimal system, thus we don't think about all kinds of special cases. Combinatoric complexity is half exponent levels smaller, compared in regards to + and -, where linear space is used, and 1/4 acceleration happens - it's position, thus, being 4/1, which we mark á¹•, where resolution is solved - p with upwards accent.

## Introduction to U

In decimal system:
- We want 9, 99, 999 to be multiplier exponent factors of the same number, so that number of digits equals R, it's actual number representation r, and the lowest possible value Q, where q can introduce a complex counterpart (imaginary part) to r, where in decimal system we divide digit to 3*3 factor to match the coordinate system.

This means:
- we add one to plus numbers
- we substract one from minus numbers
- subsequently, exactly at zero there is empty position: we use the letter "U", which can be keyword or number in our programming languages, and treated by number parsers.
  - By introducing only one reserved keyword or "Number", this is possible to support Laegna dialect in each of modern programming languages, where some can use X or V instead of "U", where they could have single-letter "You" keyword in domain-specific language to emulate two-person conversations, then use "X", or "V", or write "Zero" or "Zero-U" or "Zerou" between parenthesis if your numbers are also in text.

Thus
0 - 1 (where -0 is -1 or what comes after, -9)
1 - 2
2 - 3
3 - 4
4 - 5
5 - 6
6 - 7
7 - 8
8 - 9
9 - 10! - we got the whole digit where we wanted, to properly describe frequencies, harmonics etc.
99 - 100
999999999 - 1000000000; in Laegna this combination is called signed "EE" or unsigned "EEEE", why I said it's combinatorics-efficient towards infinity, while decimal system works well with very small numbers, like index numbers. We just don't want 9 positions on primitive value-space harmony, where for value space containing 9 positions, the information capacity space should contain 9 positions. To contract 9 (value in R - notice we have only one dimension for two, which are rather 3*3 than 3*3+1 in our case, where we just use 9 for V, infinity contraction point or frequential shift zone, where we encounter _acceleration_ to reach continuous space of numbers to ours; which might be _invisible fractal unfolding process as the digits fit on different frequential scales, and they fit to equal number thus equal digit content to atoms, if it's any realistic(al what happens:D)_) or 9 * 9 (value and space RÂ²) - you need the same digit from outside, such as 81 or 81*81, which is already big number of digits compared to "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" in Laegna, which I can at least write out or put into a lenghty table even on deck-sized paper or with smaller letters than on screen, possibly little bible for magnifying class would be a good example, which I had at home or somewhere around when I was a child, a nice toy. Altough I had more such books.

## Introduction to non-Polarity

Polarity theorem, in other words, is introducing non-Polarity:

In minus numbers, as it's a Fantasy Laegna Conversion, fantastic and not imaginary, which also has the bit to compare it realistically and still do slow, theorem-based conversions initially to figure out even such possibility, but which is still the most original I had to work for real, while others need complex spaces and memories of Laegna Numbers, where the decimal where you have to add or remove one from head, or invert the number space, is fair-enough:

- We turn the minus number digits backwards, replacing "9" with "8", "8" with "7", "0" with "1" and vice versa and linearly to inside, to repeat the same minus one and plus one combination with "7", "6", 5", ...
- We still count the numbers from upwards, and thus we have to use the equally same digit values.
- We want which was 0, to be two separate values: "-9", equalling "-99" etc., and "0" or "+0", equalling "00" and even "+00". There is "U" in between, but perhaps later we want "UUU.UUU" to understand why we now have the average value on even 6 information containers, not just a single number representing zero: generally, in Laegna, making a number longer is it's repetition; but rather you read the high-frequency numbers generally into same many-digit number, while you work with low-frequency numbers rather locally; for example, that way the only solution is proper "L" and "R" mapping, where they should come halfway like cubic translation, where you use the matrix QH or QR for 3 compounds, where both do half combinatorics approaching infinity, but there where the numbers normally become uncountable, they form two sides of the _imaginary_ counterpart or _negative_ dimension respecively in both ways, or it can be _superpositive_ on the lower side, looking from our side: by the relation to what is behind from the future dimension. Or we might map to our history, back in time, where it might connect our dimension as _superpositive_, where we see it _negatively_. Connecting outwards, we map V, where the relation from the future's last infinitesimal in scale connects, _on value level_, to past's last one, but through symbiosis the _infinity is still later_; at R of X, where T is our current doings, the R itself is the _operation we are going through_, because we take the same number and symmetrically equal to it's fractal on lower frequency, which is _non-eternal_, _material existence_, and thus as it's number is also in dimensional length and perhaps containment a level down, inside space and time not their own direction regards ours or in our-dimensional space we feel as our own surrounding, where I say Mind=Self - in the coordinate alignment, the natural consequence to see that counterpart of it's own direction is limited to mapping of such relation from infinity, where the _meaning_ of it's _original seed_ fits the _result_ of his final _consequence_, where theorem of Karma might be seen as _interactive reason to causality and it's consciousness_.

We use 3-digit number to map the infinity: with 9 actual digits, we get 3*3 space from half-linearization where we map infinities; approximity is close to one of Laegna number, while the _reason_ for such symmetries is inheretly _harder to explain_. While, with your decimal background, you would use this perfectly: it's also _hard to explain_, why this would not be _among practical implementations_ of near-perfect Laegna systems.

So we would map:
-9 to -1
-8 to -2
-7 to -3
-6 to -4
-5 to -5
-4 to -6
-3 to -7
-2 to -8
-1 to -9
We keep distinct bit to know, which one is -1 and which one is 1.
We write: U; then it's exactly zero primarily for minus-plus operation fit.
We trite underscore "_" if we don't know the character: we ask AI to translate these into numbers, we measure the numbers statistically and thus use batches, where we apply the fit factor to each set of cards regarding to L calculation, which can get together: 1/4 is operation of insane power, through infinity, so to combine it throughoutly, we instead use 1/2 on two sides: 9-system would fit if first part is linearly, second part with 3/1 power complexity so that they get 9*9=81, or to fit Laegna they would also like 9*9!9 in 9 subsequent exponent numbers; but they do the same on both sides, and use _linear conversion_ - the whole number becomes linear. Given that to polarize towards infinity, where you need subsequent factor: to have one digit of complexity over your space, for example to fix rounding of number 0.8, you would want to know whether it's rather 0.81 or 0.89, and sometimes you want to replace it with 0.9 in latter case to fix rounding you would get from only the whole numbers, it also depends what means "8" on the last digit. I sometimes use "!" at end of number for infinite repetition, in this case 0.0! or -9.9! would give zero as well, because it's outside our actual frequency, given in dimension where they map together at some measureable point in infinity, by their dimensional complexity and range, where they behave like U, just being it in 50%:50% degree. If you add a higher frequency, you have that content: more realistic local numbers reflect their past and future curves somehow inside, and locally have the more precise angle; for example, with point angles of given degrees, often how we navigate the obstacles, you form complex angles in space, and where you form number from digits: each digit for small partial walk, and several digits for longer walks, where the _statistical angle_ is finally a series of digits to form a big number: it's not pointing so well perhaps if you consider it a growing number, but the digits with 1/4 symmetries map well that it's _still_ frequentially equal to linear system, because the digits have "shadow counterparts" that each scale, scope, size, but also 1/4 frequential and dimensional conversion, the digits must remain the same; for example, if you multiply two numbers and lose some digits in beginning or end, it's a slow-priority position where you repeat the rest of the pattern as if it was a wheel: you start, from where the sequence ends, again with it's counterpart which now became hidden; thus you guarantee the number statically points into a direction in infinity, however imprecise: digits, when they are more, are not very imprecise in their union, where even statistics matters: it converts the number in L=>R scale, which as frequential opposition maps to R=>T in numbers, in that order (so where you write RTRTRT to form i * RRR + TTT counterpart, you see this is mapping L:R itself, instead of having this local precision, you have another global one: where you see multiplication and division, positionally in regards to where you see addition and subtraction; and you see one high-order operation of equal 1/2 conversion between them in higher space, and from the way you map infinity: you see, in regards to V, space of adding and subtraction ends, where multiplication and division _accelerate_ to other side of their dimension in approximating or preceiding number space; where + and - are strictly closed to their square in the operations; thus V maps the information format: when you reach infinity, it's relation to past would show you the operation in the present, in regards to R counterpart of RTRTRT numbers; which repeat their symmetries to infinity - as long as you do calculations, so as mathematician, you could still find clever ways to _not_ do those calculations, and faster processors to _overcome_ this need and make it's fruits _more efficient_ in accelerated space).

We should map "%" operation to represent the space without zero.
