# Go

We use it as:
- If we preprocess scripts to low-level language, like C, we actually generate equivalent Go code to what we want to compile, optimize and have at low level (we can also use Julia for rather dynamic environment, as it has JIT compiler).
- A statically typed, low level and efficient programming language.

These needs, in Laegna context, will be answered by Go.
