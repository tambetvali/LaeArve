Write the preprocessor, which garbage collectors:
- Starting from H3, each chapter structure which is more than 5 nested chapters even if you open the documents. It leaves "continue" links.
- Starting from H3, each list of chapters with more than 5 subsequent chapters is contracted.
- Starting from H3, if count as blocks, where more than 127character blocks count as multiblocks, not more than 40 blocks can be contained within H3, with link.

- Use Flask: link creates a subpage, where this is H1, the block linked, and thus more content is shown, but it's also garbage-collected.
