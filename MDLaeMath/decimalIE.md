= Laegna Latin implementation =

This Schooling System is meant to:
- Implement Laegna Mathematical Trainer as it's first mission.
- Implement Laegna Latin Mathematical Trainer as it's second mission.

This means:
- Include decimal systems, and decimals systems with Laegna elements, which are mappable to Laegna math.
- Include mixed math lessons with Laegna math and Decimal math.

Map zeroes and infinities:
- Numbers such as Y12 would mean 12 into infinity in decimal.
- Numbers such as Z12 would mean 12 into zero in decimal.
- Decimal octaves would map to Laegna octaves.

== Decimal => Laegna octaves ==

Laegna Octave 0 numbers would, to map to infinite system, contain infinite number of digits.
This is the common property of decimal system.

Laegna Octave 1 numbers would map infinities to finite number of digits, such as 4.
Decimal systems, then, need to map infinities to finite number of digits.
- This could map to geometry: using geometric properties to define numbers, such as referring to real world measures as units, for example an unit for point angle in curved line, and sharp point angle; some examples are given on Laegna web pages and documentations, but it would be your interesting math lesson to find more, and to implement them. With decimal numbers, XYZ can be used. These numbers, their squares, square roots, opposing zeroes and physical conditions for negative symmetries would do.

== Physical Goal ==

Find infinities in physics:
- **Map infinities, zeroes, negative infinities and zeroes to SI system**, using it's numbers as sources for number systems, possibly also using normalized versions, for example SI conversion where 0 maps to some SI zero, where round number like 1 000 000, or other important number in decimal system would map to given infinity of this unit in relation to some other unit; for example flatness of Earth as infinity in relation to human size and especially the coordinate system we live in - for larger creature, Earth would not be flat, for example in some coordinate systems it's rather round shape like globe (if not so round, then definitely having as little infinity degree).
- **Use number properties for infinities**. While an AI would not be able to write an infinite number to it's memory, and every infinity in actual real numbers would easily need this; in a lot of mathematics, we rather average.
- - Imagine a number 0.00001 - **for most purposes, it's equal to** zero. For example, with measurement tape, we rather _do not see any difference_, and while we might with laser interference device - many people are not interested, for practical purposes.
- - In **infinity math**, we are interested in _outside symmetries_. For this purpose, if not 10000, which we can in some cases measure - counting millimeters, related to our size, and being really able to distinguish one millimeter -; for larger number like 10000000, a few people only are able to find one unit, where they see the whole unit. Comparing small numbers to infinities give relations comparative to this number size, and math for many purposes is simply equal. For example, given the number of people on Earth, and their complex set of relations, when we measure the karmic interaction, such as business theory: the amount in which the contribution of one human being relates to all people on Earth is more or less equal, in many qualitative senses, to the contribution we would ideally do helping the whole Universe of known and unknown beings - for example, we can watch the future and consider our deeds as basis for anything humans do in the future; when we generalize this, we cannot do more than helping other people around us; while we might be more serious in this once we understand the scopes, for example helping to reach Mars in the beginning; the real result is rather: you are not going to bring less food to your family if you know that humans won't reach the planets, or if they reach the planets later. If you help one person, compared to helping five - with five persons, you might be more serious if you can really help them, and for example you would reserve a table in the restaurant, whereas for one person you won't - trivially, ethics is different. If you are going to help North America versus helping North and South America, the difference is *far less trivial*, for example you would rent a football hall in both cases; rather you cannot easily imagine a concrete difference. For example, if you land on Earth and Saturn, despite the mass being very different, which is the practical thing - you would not measure much in terms of their *flatness* (for earth is not flat like a glass, but rather flat like a mountain, the other factors that come into play are far more serious).
- - In ethics, you rather measure an ethical horizon: it's appearing in front of you, for most purposes, like 90 degrees. The fact that you *help* people or *do not* starts from certain scope, for example a president of a small country like Italy would be as serious thing as president of a large country like Argentina - here, the _quality_ is already larger factor than the _quantity_.

== Examples ==

To understand the background, I give you two examples mappable to Laegna Latin.

=== Mapping Decimal Numbers to infinities ===

TODO: Integrate these numbers to map second octave Laegna numbers to actual decimal numbers, where zeroth-octave of Laegna numbers can be infinite themselves, without reaching infinities (zeroeth octave would reach it with number EEEE in typical writing, E-long E, where E=4, or EE with signed numbers, where E=2); we use different tricks to still represent the first octave as we are not inherently *against* the decimal system.

In decimal mathematics, it's hard to find infinities. Instead, if we are going to do proper conversions between infinities and decimals, we do the following:

Zero and Infinity compared to human beings, as measured by size units:
* In this regard, consider that human life is infinite as you cannot pass that number. We measure in regards to human size in space and time, and while humans in the future may live longer, this is a way to map our actual reality - just as with infinity, we don't play for numbers above infinity or below zero (regarding to zero as in Thermodynamics, not as in your own money where you can have loans - universally we don't have loans, in total, along with the potential field).
* Where material bodies are smooth, not made of little particles, but solid bodies. The number, under which the smoothness stops, is zero and you can use decimal "0". Under this number is sub-zero, where you map to minus numbers and use Laegna sub-zero.
* Where Earth is flat, this is some infinity - flatness might arrive under this radius, but the radius of Earth, given that there are different, relative infinities, is imaginable infinity to us.
* Planes can still get around the Earth, but you consider this an accelerated space, and infinities of any degree can be overcome in accelerated space; the time it takes for human to walk around Earth, this has to be seen as infinity as well, if infinity is not human life length in time.

In physics:
* Positive infinity of distance is the distance, at which we become flat by relativity theory, and cannot get further - for example, a point of comparative absolute flatness can be absolute infinity (8), whereas when we are flat enough, this is the normal infinity (4).
* Positive infinity of speed is speed of light.
* Numbers can approach these infinities, but not reach them completely - those numbers are the octaves at sub-Y, whereas imaginary speeds and distances over the number are super-Y, which we can calculate with Laegna mathematics.

In number theory:

Case 1:
* While in decimal system we won't have absolute infinity, we have *precision* - for example, our Laegna number precision can be that for numbers above and below one and zero and minus one, for each we always only use maximally 100 digits. Trivially, where 100 digits are E's, to represent largest numbers, or I's for smallest, when we have internal representation of 101 digits, we add one A or O, respectively, behind the scenes; more or less; we use a's and o's, small-caps digits, or U.AAA and U.OOO taking 2 digits more and thus being 2 digits less in information and precision. In regards to infinity, zero and minus infinity, we keep the numbers perfect in given precision if the decimal numbers, which appear when we hiddenly add one number, which is not in such extreme, after our precision (or decimal precision if this is the basis for infinity). To operate with division and multiplication of zero and infinity, we then use representations, which utilize the numbers to be constants; now, doing calculations with large hidden precision we won't lose it.
* For those precision numbers, we use powers - inf\*inf represents second-order infinity, 0\*0 represents second-order 0 etc.
* If we keep dynamic memory of our calculations, the infinity window can change size and position when we do operations.

Case 2:
* We represent number with tangent of it, or any other function, which would infinitely approach infinity, and continue the tangent behaviour above zero as well; we add Z or Y before that number if we want, which is still decimal but using some Laegna digits, like Z0.00000001 would represent zero in some system, or tan(a) = 1 would mean that a is infinitely close to infinity. From 1, we could get 1 squared for example, but this is already Laegna math.

Conclusively:
* While it's still Laegna, we call it Laegna Latin if we apply some primitives of Laegna to decimal numbers so that they can be representatives to Laegna system as well, in Latin world.
