While I don't like Python implementation for superfolder imports, thus I think it's not considered.

I think when we have library with no dependencies, we can have it in books - this is a generic library rather than our system component; it knows the position of each file in filesystem tree: we map it through a leaf of moebius to get the primary side of a card: opposite for Website user and it's programmer, who is interested in Reflecting in each case in Dev Environment, whereas they test the actual Knowledge-first: Books aspect, where even the Base Code and the Temple are merely reflected by a single book.
