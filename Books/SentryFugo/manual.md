# Manuals and Automations

We write these documentations not knowing:
- Whether users do those operations manually.
- Whether we implement automation for the functionality.

Our Standards do not necessarily imply each kinds of automations.
- For example, Wikipages can be created manually, and their content used manually to train an AI.
- For example, embeddings or models can be added manually.

## Iterative process of non-Centrified solutions

In an era of an AI, we should be more free about our standards.
- We can let AI watch all the manual work we do about all kinds of _techniques and technologies_ we develop.
- We write manuals for users, at the same topics where we write architectures for automation.
  - We can implement some means of automation, but where we tackle into real-world complexities: leave them to collaboration of user and AI.
  - We won't close any standards, while we close the case that the standardization is _enough_.
    - For example I let exact use of \_\_ and \_\_ open. We can define terms in various ways in free sentences.
    - This is separate work to search for exceptions, manually working through selection of materials, or letting an AI handle this, or collecting any kind of "errors".
    - Result is not standardizing the content, because that would lead to cryptic and non-dynamic content, where we don't want to be "dumb officials", but intelligent people, who accept personalities and decisions.
    - User would create a Wikipage, where they:
      - Get the context snippets as input, where there are terms defined.
      - Possibly get additional input about which dictionary items were created.
      - They would alter "Dictionary Items" and create proper Dictionary Items with proper context added.
      - They would link back: while our parser would initially add the same items, it would also get updates: over time, it would understand and generate updates, so that it _becomes_ that wikipage.
