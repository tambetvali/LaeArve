# Laegna Math Server: Standard Documents

"""
  Here are the standard documents.

  Standard documents are each, which are contained in the local tree, and belong to the package
  rather than books, which are then "custom content". Mainly because the documents define the
  standard of the rest of the content, following the _reproductivity rule_ (well I like my
  English myself, Estonians would not imply that I don't know Estonian at all, but in English
  it's poetry mixed with mistakes, not so convincing).
