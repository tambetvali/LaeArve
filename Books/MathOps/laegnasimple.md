# Laegna Simple Operators

In it's simple form, Laegna uses latin operators:
- * - multiplication
- /, \\ - division, also reverse-dimension if needed (where you bring it closer to infinity, rather than zero, where I or A as 1/4 gives an opposition into 4\\1 into infinity, in the way they map to one, and this is then E in both cases of I and A; 1/8 is the name of such relation, covering two frequencies with the same number - for this I use decimals, as they are just perfectly eight with two zeroes; the position of higher and lower limit value of the number system does not change: if each digit represents a value in given frequency band, one has this-dimensional number, which is easily comparable range also in full numbers: such as Laegna 999999 means 1000000 as zero is U, where 999999˙U means limit value, which is that much curved towards infinity, which is not rotated in any way in decimal system; for 1000000 indeed you need exponential digits in the same range, and you get something like Ŕ - R with upwards accent).
- + - addition
- - - subtraction
- · - average (multiply, then stretch to the same length as average of numbers multiplied, for example E·E·E still gives E, which is the average).
- : - geometric average: actually defined, if you do it with two operators, it starts from direction of E or 9 (I use it for 8 sometimes, for it's representative of the last number and also used as 8 in higher-frequency complex numbers). This average means you go __outwards__ of the same degree.

Additionally:
give range of a number, where for number:
AEEEAEEA
The range could be:
EEEEEEEE - upper limit
AAAAAAAA - positive lower limit
U - zero limit between O and A
IIIIIIII - lower limit

With keeping variable in such state that:
Upper limit exists
Variable exists
Lower limit exists

For example compressing into: number of digits used creates the limits, for example constant 32 digits, where 64-bit variable could be used in Latin binary framework to emulate Laegna Logex (_machine language_ of Logecs, my _Logic Machine_). In such case, still one variable with given value is used.

For digits as well, the range is given, often by base (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 - in 0 dimensions, you can still switch between U and _, which is nothing, not even unknown, for example to mask bits; each system has _ to omit one digit from a number or some use of words).

For base-4 or IE system:
- Lower limit for digits is I
- Numbers are given digit values
- Higher limit for digits is E

Base 16 or complex number base is written as base44, as it could be the highest digit, or is a two-dimensional number.

For mixed base system, each digit range is important:
- Minus numbers could exist, where each digit has minus and plus range; where I need integers, not floats, I use small letters for minus digits, otherwise minus sign could be used for all digits at once, where small digits are used to replace "," or ".", which is used otherwise for continuous numbers and their markers, use not needed by discrete systems. Minus dimension is continuous with the number, each minus component can be added, but not involved in base range, whereas afterwards, certain number with same number of digits as given, would contain given minus number in range which was initially negoted and added, so that digit ranges -2 (-2, 0) 3 (0, 3) and -4 (-4, 0) would initially give ranges 2, 3 and 4; then an integer within these ranges with values 2 0 and 4 in digits: this number is substracted from the positive intermediate result to get the actual minus number, where each digit can have positive and negative range, possibly a complex of those.
- Sometimes I use positive numbers inside U to divide a number: Ú and U with two upwards accents: those digits can be used to compose a number, which would be used to divide, for example in case of using in multiplication, where its then E * Ü where dots represent upwards accents, gives A, because the infinity was multiplied with zero divided by infinity, but "*" in Laegna tends to assume positive infinitesimals: right answer is O·A, but in one digits and positive preferrance it's rather A than O; for example E / Ü would then give E square or EE; in unsigned number Ü is indeed still in same relation with infinity, so the result would look the same.
