# Scalability

## At iteration zero and below, which are the first iterations in our simplified system

iter1 prefixed files in MDLaePage describe things, which were simplified from their files _without_ prefix, subject in MDGenDocs (the permanent memories for Cascade the AI) for additional simplifications, give us this structure:
* In MDGenDocs/iter1_aianalysis.md we have the most simplified ideas in the end, currently, in my answer to the first conversation.
* MDLaePage/iter1_*.md was the previous simplification.
* MDLaePage files currently named luichapters.md, luipages.md, luiparams.md were the previous thing to simplify.
* Folder "Old" contains luicanvas.py, luichapters.py, luipages.py and luiparams.py, which were not simplified, but the initial versions - it's non-working, but it basically implements the structure and headers for the initial system, where I targeted advancement. It might not be *more advanced* in every sense than the simplified versions - rather, it's at the same time, by some aspects an initial draft, and by some aspects containing basic advanced ideas; however, in later simplifications the advanced ideas also might have got simpler.

Given this: while now we work with very simplified version, it should be scalable to initial ideas - in our conversation, only a few features were finally left, as given in MDGenDocs/iter1_aianalysis.md with my agreement with applying a set of simplifications to user interface and other areas. When we implement this, it should be *OOP* and *Scalable* to more advanced ideas we still have in files.
* For example: every change we do should keep a little bit in direction of reaching those goals over time, like more complex chapter and block structure and more complex property selector, as well as all the formats in case we would dismiss something. We do not remove all the simplifications, as others are going to program too and the entry barrier should not be too high, but we are targeting the *essential qualities* in those files, to reach all that functionality.

In this file, I will keep it up to date to scalability considerations.
