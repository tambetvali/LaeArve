# Practical Root Folder

The folder "Books" is the Root Folder of Laegna Math Website, and the folder "Books" of the Source Code.

For Client, Spider and user, this is the Practical place for start: for example, importance can start from here, so that if it considers some subfolders more and some less important, it can continue imprtance mapping - having source code at the top folder, we would need higher importance of the subfolder, which means low-level AI knows too much about a high-level AI instead of having it's context available up to a degree; for summarization it is helpful to have branches not directly contain the root folders: instead they reference. Indeed, we should also have a reference collector - one which simply checks that if the folder you want to dive into, or the same dynamic page, is available in the link upwards, it will notify about that and count the times - importance to learn subcard, which is already a parent card and probably called more often, is falling to zero in process of multiple containment.
