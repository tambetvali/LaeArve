# SinCos wave within interaction of R and T

__Life is Infinity__: Life is where, at infinity, the curve starts induction for acceleration curve, rather than deduction of avoiding the decceleration. This is `O` => `A` transistion. The `I` and `E` in their final sense are avoided, if the polar signed type is used to consider them Negotive and Posetive - rather, they provide a constant effect; `I` coming from that initially, the failure is very close, and `E` that finally, we need something while each try for absolute ideal is a failure. We have the law of thermodynamics: what is actually reached, is not considered below zero or above infinity; the law effectively states that zeroes `U` and `V`, in some final coordinate system, which has posetive and negotive in given number system: where the absolutes always interact with us through complex number spaces, they cannot actually appear; where we can waste, but not when we have _actually_ ran out of money, and where we can waste, but not when out plan is _actually_ more than there is. In both cases, our effort would fail: while, it's important to tolerate less (in laegna polarity - they are on the same line, so "tolerate less" means we are tolerant to more, where we use r<-> or r switch to bring the other opposite of the same-linedness, by k, the tao factor of not being able to completely express the inherit polarities of Tao) and to achieve more (this is upper same-linedness, which means we won't achieve what we cannot, the presence of Zen in the same sentence - Tao means that the truth, in the bigger scope, is not truth, where T is theorem and o comes after a, but they both are _after_ T thus this value zero is position by being an average of zero and one - the average and position, R and T, where RT component is a single value squared, where we do multiplication and addition, we have what I called addiction and multitude in one chapter; we use just reminders to see how each operation on one frequency is inevitably reflected in the _real_ value of other dimension, even if we componentize them and get the information density, which won't fit the same dimension, as well as more imperfections: the time it takes for them to interact and actually reflect their sameness, where R is much more expensive than T, and T provides much more essential need - T is finite, and R is infinite, whereas they are rather containers).

_Even and Odd connectors_, __The Book of Life and Death__: in RT notation, where we connect RT with unity or point acceleration, we must connect the opposite TR with separation or even point decceleration to have any values at all. One happens in real and other in complex space. By R<->, from complex space itself we see it vice verse - TR is then the unity of Negation, and RT is the separation of Negations, and notice the Negations are "good".

_The Book of Life and Death_, __Eredad Retced__: here I play with Estonian: "ere" is eternal life; while "dad" is single position rather potential, "ret" is returning or where infinity of r becomes t again, "ced" is rather that it happens in union, or fractally from outside in and backwards, from inside out. In Estonian, it has foreign letters but means: "vivid trips". This states that Life and Death are fluctuation of _R_ and _T_: _R_ is the harmonic, the power of evolution, love, the final goal, which comes from outside and creates us - it's equal to us as a preliminary, Z value, and creates us; _T_ is the particular, momentary presence and when it's created, it follows it's simple matrix straight; but then as _R_ evolves and _T_ succeeds, it will lose it's _base reason_ and become _obsolete_: the life force is not connected to the source. Being already dead, it now walks to death: from that moment, it has reason to exist, but again based on the harmonic wholeness.

_Giving death a chance_, __Phoenix and the Horse__: in Laegna, a "chance" is a position word and giving death a chance rather means, we _allow_ our life to continue, unless Latin Polarity is used - which is also typical as we have R and we have T, we have the unification and the separation of the language, and we cannot assume binary truth, but we assume r<-> the r switch. R and T vibration is not specific to life, but to any mathematical factor; so rather than instantly solving our own life into immortality, we set a realistic strategy: we won't progress fast, so it's Zen process with small LÃ­s, but we see this fluctuation in our material creations, thoughts, emotions and even enlightenment states: it wobbles through sinus and cosinus, when it rebuilds the conus (I use for sine and cosine and cone these estonian- or perhaps a bit latin-like endings, where in Laegna, "e" is the +infinity end, final success, while "us" is kind of unknown or negatively, the metaphysical static stance of not having nothing else to know or follow, a kind of infinity where "su" might mean it's locally unclear, but finally / eternally rather decided, as a metaphysical fact: a repetition, which keeps itself together, being constantly contained in). In each case, where there is a general solution, we still work through temporary solutions: getting deeper and more open to possibilities, Zen and Tao, being mindful to find our True Selves: we make the fractal to carry the values through, while it's still transforming (and perhaps Buddha sayd we rather target this mental immortality), where transforming might mean the same cycle: as more we connect and unify the broken pieces of our mirror (1000 broken mirrors), as more we get *every part of the fractal* unified: then, the death does not have a reason - you see how it can sound bad in context to say "the death has a reason", because if we remove negative reason, the result is then a position reason! Still we have to rotate it a little: there are different values, any by k it takes time to synchronize with all; being on the same line is not one-faceted thing.
