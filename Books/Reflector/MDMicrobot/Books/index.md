# ðŸ”° Microbot Books
__Summary__: Short versions of Books,
  especially existing books, for
  pretraining and training of small bots.

For books, minimalized versions go here:
- Short chapters and paragraphs without
  unnecessary aspects.
- Lessons and tasks have short numbers and
  small number of ops, where user's
  selection would decide the exact
  magnitude and lessons differ.

This file also contains _realistic line
numbers_, where third line of text does not
span the second page.
