## Hugging Face

Reason for not using:
- Downloader "transformers" fails compability flags, which means it's an _advanced solution to simple problem_.
- Needing time, effort and understanding, it's not up to our standards of _freedom_, even if it's given as default case. We might do this for final products, but in our playground, each part needs to be _simple_ and _free_, to support __KISS__, __Open Source__ and __Agile Methodologies__. We avoid overcomplications and excess of resources by our providers, also optimizations for trivial parts, such as downloading, unless they are clearly optional.
