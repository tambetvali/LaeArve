# Books

There can be abundance of books, because we organize them and refer to them, book metadata and positioning should determine where it belongs. Some topics need your feedback: while I write short article, there could be several related materials; over time I extend the topics so there is some referential map. Currently there is like an article or two about the topic.

I call them "Books" in context of my information system, where they could be items, where people could add some knowledge bases or other information based on my theory, and their expressions of it.
