# Hugging Face FineTuning: Research Pending

__Currently:__ _NOT USING_!
- _But you might want to ___test___.

Sorrily versions of transformers and existing software are conflicting as long as I check, and it's using TensorFlow:
- It's an important resource we indirectly use a lot to download different models for Jan, GPT4All and LM Studio, which all have this source built-in.
- The fine-tuning depends on TensorFlow rather than PyTorch, which would mess with our environment with some choices; at the same time: use it freely to produce finished, GGUF models and embeddings to us.
- It's constantly broken, the version control, and in the beginning it was broken the book version and library version of code, where I could run _nothing_. Until I see something standard-like, I am unable to comment this thing: if you are in cutting-edge flow and create new versions daily, replacing your paper books at homes and libraries, perhaps you would have some success with me. I don't know how you would reach my home to replace my book, because I'm not willing to fill too many personal details and aquintances with all the books and libraries.
