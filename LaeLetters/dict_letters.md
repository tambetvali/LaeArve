> Notice that numeric values depend on the number system, so there are various alternatives. Example here is dimensionally true, whereas other values of U and V are usable in other places - rather than seeing them differences in values, see them as differences of axes, where on other axe the same number would behave equally well where it has axe-dependent value, such as lenght of my hand in millimeters and centimeters could be very different.

**V**: Properly written as upside down U, this is the point where circle will meet it's beginning again. As it's digit, not a number, depending on it's position for example Logical Truth can here meet it's cycularity: what happens in the future, will actually *measure* the past, so it would travel back as *measurement* - the meaning we give to the past. It's the main principle of Ponegative, my Logecal System, that the initial condition has different *Meaning* as we meet, in the end, the reality about intentions in the beginning. Ponegative value of **V** is **Neglection**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **4** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **16**.

**E**: Ponegative value of **V** is **Posetion**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **2** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **4**.

**A**: Ponegative value of **V** is **Position**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **1** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **3**.

**U**: Ponegative value of **V** is **Unegotion**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **-16** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **-4**.

**O**: Ponegative value of **V** is **Negation**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **-1** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **2**.

**I**: Ponegative value of **V** is **Negotion**; *Signed Numeric Value* is **-2** and *Unsigned Numeric Value* is **1**.
