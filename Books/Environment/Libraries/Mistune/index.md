## Our Workflow and Mistune's Role

Our workflow revolves around using Markdown files enriched with **Jinja2 templates**. Unlike traditional templates designed solely for HTML rendering, our Markdown files contain dynamic variable data that can be populated through Jinja2, allowing us to create flexible and reusable content.

### Markdown File Processing
- **Markdown to Block Format**: Mistune is utilized to parse Markdown files into a block structure. This intermediate format enables us to process content with precision, including handling variable data and applying transformations.
- **Block Format to HTML**: After processing, Mistune converts the Markdown blocks into HTML for rendering on web pages.
- **Back to Markdown**: In certain cases, Mistune enables us to reverse the process, converting the processed content back into Markdown format. This ensures that our results are retained in an editable and portable format.

### Flask Integration
Flask serves as our web server, hosting the content generated through Mistune. Mistune’s simplicity and speed align perfectly with Flask’s lightweight and modular design. Together, they form a seamless system for dynamic web applications.

## Formatting Source Files

Mistune also allows us to showcase Python and Markdown files as **source code** with proper formatting. By leveraging its rendering capabilities, we can display code snippets directly within our web pages in a structured and visually appealing manner. This is particularly valuable for documentation and educational purposes, where readability and organization are key.
