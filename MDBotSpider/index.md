# Laegna Math Spider
This is the system to feed data to AI fine-tuner or download the generated content into the real file system.

Instead of Server, it uses the Client to parse data into HTML, Markdown and Json formats.

## Name of the Bot Spider

It's called Laegna Bot Spider (Lbs), not Laegna Math Spider (Lms), because the server itself is rather called Lms, also because the user will customize the bot and rather not the website or Laegna Math Framework, which is the common name for the system.
