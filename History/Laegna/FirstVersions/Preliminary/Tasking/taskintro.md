# Project: Teaching New Math to Old AIs

## **Introduction**
This project focuses on creating an adaptable framework to teach AI models new mathematical systems, specifically Laegna Math. By leveraging existing question-and-answer datasets, conversion tools, fine-tuning methodologies, and flashcard systems (like Genanki), the project aims to evolve traditional AI models into learners capable of understanding innovative numeric concepts. 

This implementation is designed as a *lesson*, not as a guaranteed final solution. It serves as a foundation for exploration, collaboration, and development. Readers can use this framework to refine datasets, improve functionalities, or expand AI capabilities based on their needs. While errors or limitations may exist, they provide opportunities for meaningful engagement with both the system and the mathematical ideas behind it.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Understanding Laegna Math**:
   - Equip AI with the ability to recognize patterns and operations unique to Laegna Math.
   - Teach AI to connect numbers in the decimal system with concepts from Laegna Math.

2. **Fine-Tuning AI Models**:
   - Adapt pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen or Llama) to work with mathematical flashcards containing converted numbers and Q&A data.
   - Enable the AI to generalize from lessons to more complex implementations of mathematical reasoning.

3. **Engaging Users**:
   - Allow users (even non-programmers) to participate in refining AI models.
   - Highlight tools like VSCode, GitHub, and Copilot for collaborative programming and version control.

4. **Flashcard Integration**:
   - Generate Genanki decks containing converted lessons for teaching and testing the AI.
   - Encourage users to expand datasets or correct existing cards to improve accuracy.

5. **Deploying and Sharing**:
   - Train the AI using accessible resources and make the resulting model available in GGUF format.
   - Provide options for local execution (via LM Studio or GPT4All) and online sharing (via Flask and Mistune).

## **Overview of the Workflow**
### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
- **Source**: Math lesson datasets from Hugging Face, containing school-level Q&A in integer formats.
- **Processing**:
  - Use regex to find and convert all integers (positive and negative).
  - Apply converters (`OriginalConverter` or `LetterConverter`) to replace numbers based on predefined rules.

### Step 2: Fine-Tuning the AI Model
- **Model Selection**: Choose Qwen or Llama versions (0.5B, 1B, 1.5B, or 2B).
- **Training**:
  - Tokenize converted questions and answers using Hugging Face's tools.
  - Train the model with PyTorch on the processed dataset.
  - Adjust hyperparameters for better learning efficiency.

### Step 3: Genanki Flashcard Creation
- **Deck Structure**:
  - Each question and answer pair is converted and stored as a flashcard.
  - Export flashcards as `.apkg` files for offline learning and testing.

### Step 4: GGUF Model Export
- **Purpose**:
  - Save the fine-tuned model in GGUF format for compatibility with tools like LM Studio and GPT4All.
  - Facilitate local execution or online integration.

## **Empowering Users Without Programming Expertise**
Modern programming tools allow non-experts to engage meaningfully with AI projects. This project emphasizes:
1. **Programming Tools**:
   - Use VSCode for coding and documentation.
   - Install and run Python files generated by AI tools.
   - Explore and understand APIs instead of deep coding logic.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Collaborate effectively through GitHub repositories and Git integration.
   - Track changes and contributions for continuous improvement.

3. **Markdown Documentation**:
   - Present complex ideas in a structured, accessible format.
   - Serve Markdown files as webpages using Flask and Mistune.

## **How This Project Advances AI**
By teaching AI models new mathematical concepts, we unlock their ability to:
- Learn abstract patterns and relationships.
- Adapt to non-traditional numeric systems like Laegna Math.
- Help users experiment with innovative ideas without needing extensive programming skills.

This collaborative approach positions AI as an evolving learner, capable of adapting to the needs of its creators and contributors. Together, we're pushing the boundaries of traditional AI capabilities, transforming "old AIs" into pioneers of new mathematics.
