# Theorems

This Study Card Set (these Study Cards /contain) contains Laegna Main Theorems for Material and Spiritual world; a rough estimation of Reality.

## Theorems of Incompleteness

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: Value by which we measure our system cannot be complete.

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: A mathematical values exists on real and imaginary plane, geometrically mapping to _causal_ and _projective_ spaces, where _causal_ is the actual reality, and we do not know it's value, but we _optimize_ it, and _projective_ is the world as we know it; by R <->, causal is the actual dimension we point to, and _projective_ is the projective of this dimension, the projection matrix, which points to the bias. Based on the first implication of the theorem itself, that we cannot be based on two logical values, we have defined the _opposition_ of the term to form a binary pair of I, O, A and E - _Ten_, numerically _Two_ values are assigned. We say _causal_ [UR/V] _projective_ to state that the _position_ of the Axe related to two values are unknown. Now we have a _Mathematical Measure of the System_, where we agree that the _Underlying Reality_ has hidden projection to a binary plane, how the _perceived values_ **Actually** (this means, eternally, especially in RÍ, the up-accent _I_, the _materializing_ aspect of the inwards reality, which I call _Higher Magic_ (Whole), the non-materializing aspect of it, Ì or down-accent _I_, and the possibly materializing, intentional with or without (X IE<->OA projection matrix between those two spaces, an _intent_), aspect of it, or painfully lacking a proper intent, and the _I_, either _Lower Magic_ (Rest) in base-IE, the base of Set of Natural Numbers, or _Neutral Magic_ (All)), view [UnityRepresentation][1] in Laegna Math, about _how to write R unities (R of unity, in one letter, is **L** - the **Left**)_.

_First Theorem of Imperfection_, __Logecs Theorem__: @_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, which means the terms are indistinguishable as one redirects to the other.

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: we are optimizing towards a value, not having the materialized ideal in reality, neither in base Truth Mapping of Math we use to explain it.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: That reality can be explained in binary form by True and False, and life can be determined by Yes and No as a logic system.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Imperfection, __Tenary Theorem__: @_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, which means the terms are indistinguishable as one redirects to the other.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Binary Completeness Conjecture__: by operating in binary space, we could get a statistical measure of solution set, using it as closed logical system and analyzing the invariance, that the invariant or "theorem" based on the Truth Value Table which appears and connects to each Logecs value of input with it's output, and maps the letters to understand the Truth Value Table based on it's "eternal value" where we measure the time-bound system based on it's experience and the estimation of values; where we reach the conclusion, what are the values and why, we can estimate the eternal value (with time and space removed, <i>L</i>L\_2 or <i>L</i>L<b><i>L</i>L</b> value, using the spatial ponegation, we consider how the initial binary tables have the statistical measure by their use, and the value of HZL, where we take their averages and map back to Z - the space of particular examples; and generalize with H, their "vertical" value, where the mapping space sees the space of actual entities as L, a flat structure of set of potential and actual cases of the Truth Value Table, where in itself it's Template (H) or generalized particulars (ZL, where L near-zero mapping of R appears at it's higher octave as only infinity maps you as a person, whole unit with count A or one, into a point with count UE or ZE or ZAE - a count of zero, where you are simply a point, being an unit in this space; L, in ideal, then appears over space and time)). In virtual system, the simulation, you map eternity to spacetime - it's one octave down in your coordinate system of mapping eternity to spatial and temporal infinities between IE where I=-Infinity and E=Infinity - and get the local, material mapping, or IE where I maps to -2 and E maps to 2. Where positive and negative finities or _countable_ values, where angle of circle ends at center of the line where angle of a circle approaches zero degree turn of curve, or 180 degrees angle, the range from this point to zero is considered to be A, which you can further map by having Aa, for example, mapping the lower half of this and Ao mapping the negative frequency on this positive scale, a "knot" of one number with it's frequency, despite not being the other number, mapping into certain equality in terms of number value, but not in terms of positional value; for numbers without knots, each positional value has only distinct set of values, and position-value combinations equal in either all three of given and resulting values, or not in the resulting value.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Binary Completeness Conjecture__: @__Binary Completeness Conjecture__.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Binary Perfection Conjecture__: @__Binary Completeness Conjecture__, which would state that by binary logic, one could contemplate on life and systems without indirect implications, such as trial and error (which already is it's own antithesis since it's process is hard to reason with __binary conjecture__). Consider the Turing's "Halting Problem", which involves the binary conjecture, stating something contradictionary: when human, as a living system, applying a theorem of incompleteness, can resolve special cases of Halting Problem, the logical framework cannot do so; analysing this binary system we can state that it has hidden presumption that binary logic holds, and when viewed by human system, mystical and spiritual yes but not completely outside the logic, the assumption leads to a conclusion that humans are *not predictable* in how they resolve theorem logic and what is possible, even if they can implement their resolutions. This holds rather for living systems, the systems, which *involve imperfection*, which we are doing in this Study Card. Russell stated that it's hard to combine logic and mathematics, and this might be partially a binary conjecture, which led to such statement, involving reflection on liars and barber's paradoxes - rendering an earlier system, closer to at least achieving complete mathematical framework (and worth further study especially with machine, which can solve the paradox by *identity*).

__Theorem of Binary Ideal__: it states that in closed logical systems and systems of probabilities, such as Schroedinger's car or fundamental probabilities of physics or other philosophical systems, where they might exist in real world in probabilistic states; in each of these systems, there is a positional paradigm of Binary Truth; any Logecs value can be written, using positions *outside the normalized positions*, in binary form which holds as "unreachable ideal". The conversion follows a gaussian conversion: while acceleration of a function implies point acceleration, a non-symmetric shape of a point, in regards to projection the line can be written as series of non-accelerating points where imaginary positions exist, which fit the Theorem statement.

_The Logecs Theorem_, _Logecs Theorem_, __Theorem of Ponegation__: For the space is incomplete, we map real and projective (imaginary space) into Logex space, denoting them with I, O, A, E and unknowns with U and V, and calling I and E the extremes of Real or Ideal, while O and A the Imaginary, Projective or Practical, and using letters R and T respectively - AO and AA are the Denary values in __Den=RT__-space. We assign numbers I, E, O and A into complex space, where two truth values are used and they work in cojugation, not alone - while binary systems work, when we map this back, we do not get exact binary solution about the operation we are doing, rather we get the machine, which operates in binary space with those values, and is able to resolve them separately: for example, resolve the coordinate system appearing from change in variables in a way that they resolve R, and resolving the values themselves in a way they resolve T, but it's hard to say in terms of tautologies, what connects R and T - while it's the most important theorem ever.

_The Logecs Theorem_, _Logecs Theorem_, __Theorem of Ponegation__: It states that by applying Theorem of Imperfection to binary truth of Positive and Negative, you need to transform into 4 values Position (A), Negation (O), Posetion (E) and Negotion (I), and involve Uneton (U) and Neglection (V) as symmetric solutions.

_The Buddhist Theorem of Incompleteness, First Theorem of Laegna_, __Dukkha__: This states that in living systems, Theorem of Incompleteness holds. This states that it's holds as centrally important theorem in Human Life. Dukkha produces Karma: if we are living in thermosystems, where the law of imperfection is applied, like Christ and Buddha stated by their conventions of _Satan_, _God_, _Karma_, which are theoretical models to explain the rather clear answer: that if we live in thermodynamic and imperfect system, we need to support each others in beneficial way, but also to not support the bad consequence.

_Goedel's Proof of Incertanty, the First Theorem of Laegna_: this does not account with separate logic, but rather states that the basis for theorem of incompleteness holds. It states that we cannot close a system or a theory, into one fixed and finite state - thus, any variable in form of "final permutation" is almost certantly inheretly wrong.

_Mathemat<i>i</i>cal proofs of incompleteness, the First Theorem of Laegna_: game theory states on it's basis, that one needs to handle the uncertanties, and the condition is met in experiment. Probability theory, also meeting experimental results, does advocate that the result, in many cases, is not certain. Method of trial and error, the scientific method, has also a lot of dukkha to resolve in logical realm, not just the realm of the living system, where we see the dukkha in fact that if they can reason trial and error, it must be because they do not know the truth (the negative aspect of imperfection), they can resolve it's conditions and approach it (the positive aspect). By evolutionary result, we have the efficiency of __creativity__ and __intellect__ - an accelerative curve of meaning, where once there was an unmeaningful cause of it, as a central or evident force - we call it Z. In the Z axe, God either reasoned (neutral) or evolution blindly created us (negative), or there was a metaphysical reason for God creating us (an example of positive dynamics); in each case, there was a Cause or determinant able to create us; moreover, in Laegna's base theory, *whichever cause holds, but we use the same mathematical terminology, for example that Z Position actually holds, that equilibrum is resolved into intelligence and creativity, visible either in God, creative synchronicity, natural selection / successes as left from failures in entropy-produced set of creations or trials, but definitely in their product*. To measure the system as a logical value, we need ponegative, because the True or False are not necessarily the condition the system meets, but there is a dynamics to produce Truth from those preliminary conditions.

_God_: we can say, in form of determinant itself, the common theme which inevitably resolves is the R of the system, while the T is Z-based value of evolution, X-based value of cycles optimizing towards energy-efficiency or equilibrum, or Y-based value of Love, Higher Love, God and other sources where intelligent development might be attributes; we state that the God is the determinant of global equilibrum, where from definition of equilibrum as balancing force, it's equilibrum of interdeterminant things, and thus global equilibrum exists - the reason to be conscious is just bigger than the reason to be conscious for humans, but we do not know the evolutionary effort it takes and whether some conditions of consciousness, awareness or cognition would be met based on the future, or whether our own fields of consciousness form a bigger fractal that we meet above: while the material structure of cells is like different systems interacting through process limited by time and space, forming separate unities, whether the life on Earth, humans or any future forms of synergy and symbiosis would create conditions, which would not only by their ideal solution but also actually meet the condition that the Whole Reality, as common unit, is intelligent, creative and aware of this. While it might not be aware of this, it must apply intelligent and creative solutions, for example through unions of people to meet the requirements of the Ecosystem as a life-supporting force; while we are materialist and spiritual, we have the spiritual understanding that there is mental awareness of such unities, but also the material understanding that we can rather prove an accelerated development of systems on large scale in interaction with it's parts, which is the mechanical deduction of efficiency optimization of energy and position values; but it's either position or posetion: either an efficient solution or the actual implementation based on efficiency, the materialization. It's very large question to be answered separately, but rather than asking *whether* God exists, if God is the ideal: set of synchronization theorems we have, particularly the reason or theorem, why they hold; also the materialization: convergence or optimization towards such consequence. If the system itself won't become intelligent, we are forced to be this ourselves, the unified force: then, collectively, we are God. Representing the theorems, we are this "singularly" - while we map the whole system as holograms, and follow the determinant from our particular position, the system is slowly moving towards "materialization of God", and we have our __L__ infinitesimal: now, we ask, whether society or group of humans is alive, or only each single person in particular? We fall into philosophy rather than complete unknowledge of physical aspects; rather we cannot say how literal we are by using the word "life", such as life of a little village vs. life in a little village; or life of a family vs. life in a family, of separate members; or life of America vs. life in America. While we don't mean America is necessarily an organism like us, we can agree it's living quite demanding life. About God, also, rather than asking whether he is a biological organism, we ask what is to follow the God, and the Truth and Power of energy-efficient products on personal, global and total scale (Z, X, Y).

## Theorems of Infinity
Theorems of infinities and zeros:

_Zeroeth theorem of Infinities (and zeros)_, __Theorem of Opposition of Infinities and Zeroes; U and V__: For each theorem of infinity with relatives A and B, a theorem of zero appears with relatives B and A, respectively; from X correlates to Y as Z correlates to X in _continuous space_.

### __Projective Theorems of Infinity__:
Two main theorems of projective infinity.

_Summary of the Three Theorems_, __Projective Theorem of Infinity__: Infinity measures involve information complexity and thus additional spaces not reachable by finite, countable spatial systems, i.e. projections.

#### __Infinity by Angle of a Radius__:

_First Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Infinity Theorem__: An exact infinity is __r__, where _r_ is the radius of a circle, where the angle of it's circular line becomes 180 degree inwards, or 0 degree turn at each point. This projects the space inferior and exterior of the circular line into a _parallel space_, much like using parallels and horizontals in fashion of typical projections of Earth. This point exists as a limit value, which can not be reached _inside an infinity_, but also the time and space are not linear, if they are _not reached at all_ - rather, this point is reached in fractal manner, into higher and higher precision, which is rather the physical fact unless we live in a non-coherent system of linearity, broken much in the same way with binary mathematics. Outside, it becomes *outwards curved*, so approaching further: the circle would close outside, not inside space, and appear rather impossible than circular in non-accelerating space. _We can zoom into the limit values below zero and above infinity, reaching a next Octave, a new frequency containing new dimension with parallels for all the numbers - beyond zero and infinity, there is a complex, non-logical space_.

__Radian Zero Theorem__: Zero is the radius of the circle when the point angle at edge of the circle is 0 degrees, and it turns 360 degrees at every point. Circle of radius zero froms 360 degree angle at it's edge point, and after this comes unimaginary space (the imaginary axe).

__Octaves__: Each frequency, which exists in separate numeric space equal in information containment with our original finite space, is denoted by *octave* - 0=>1 (ZX) or 1=>Inf (XY) transformation of a number, reaching a number which was initially infinitely repeated as one single number, where fractals also generalize into their repeated shape alone by number and space properties, visible in Laegna number system. Octave is the most important notion of a number. "Repeating infinitely" means: for example, you have number "10". You write: 10101010... continuing infinitely; the result is Y10 from T frequency; if you write, in Laegna system (decimal system has slight biases in correlation of positions and realities) half infinities of ones, half of zeroes, the value is at higher frequency (Y compared to previous X), but the value is also Y10 altough it's now R-based and not T-based value; where the exact operation depends also on number system selection, given you operate within infinities, these numbers explain it very clearly - the effect does not trivially come from properties of multiplication, division, addition or substraction, which we use, but rather from properties of combinatorics of these operations, things which are guaranteed to happen in Laegna number system; decimal system would simply approach close but it might seriously fail the property as it's not a frequential number: in frequential number, understanding frequencies do not need math, such as Fourier Transform is rather trivial in Laegna Number System and visible when you watch the number, it's not even operation; this infinity property, along many others, is also not an operation when you properly follow rules and theorems of Laegna.

_Spatial Complexity Theorem of subzero and superinfinity numbers_, __Information Complexity Theorem of Geometric Extremes__: numbers below zero and above infinity: such spaces need more digits to express angles and coordinates, effectively meaning that the value becomes multidimensional; the values are unbound variables. For simplified manner, you can average the values down to original dimension, but you reach distortions of space and angles, which are not trivially there - to understand them, one needs to understand the __Information Complexity__. Information complexity is basis of Frequencies: for example, we can use this complexity to project Fourier Transforms into spaces with less obvious information complexity, and still get something comparative to having separate parallel dimensions at various frequencies (they are "parallel" in sense that they do not have equal space, but they have correspondence of points - the parallelity). This holds in any number space, indeed with r<-> applied that possibly you can construct a limited space, which is consistent, but not infinite; working with these spaces, infinity properties would appear if you do any calculations. To resolve the digit problem we introduced, you need to divide the spatial coordinates (R), including the symmetric numeric values of the space (T) altough the latter is perhaps less important in a sense, with exponentially growing factor. Now, since you did not raise dimensionality, you would lose zero - numbers near zero are more easily averaged to zero as it's deccelerating space and unlike with infinities, you would sense minor difference; from perspective of infinities your 0.(9)_10 vs. 0.(A)_10 would also be a minor difference, but then what happens with zero: you would still lose huge amounts of information, for example positions of subatomic particles would involve additional randomization and impossible positioning.

__Theorem of Line Angles__: we can state that while the edge of a circle with radius has clear angle we use in definition, the number itself has an angle in regards to other numbers; where superinfinity numbers are positively opposite, and subzero numbers are negatively the opposite to normal-range, finite numbers (OA numbers vs. IE numbers). We define Laegna numbers by this angle, where it's fractal pattern of 4 angles of -90, 0, 90 and 180 degrees. The numbers, including their relations and angular symmetries, are brought from octave 1 where the definition resides, into octave 0: value 1 is replaced to frequential value of 0, value of +inf with 1, and of -inf with -1, which is moving one octave down. Where the value was very strong, so that 90 degree angle would continue infinite time before forming a number, or another degree would continue infinite time; now the numbers only last one zero - to get number Y100 in infinity, we need infinite series of numbers X100 in finity, and to get X100 in local space, we need infinite amount of Z100 numbers (which rather equal to classical 0, whatever their value, as it's statistical unit of existence) - so while it's hard to find exact relations to infinity, but we can find angular symmetries. Whole numbers also have angular symmetries, for example reflecting the interest rate and long-term income of things, which can be expressed only by whole-number count, such as money; in reality, 10€ has some interest rate and the value behind it is supposed to grow in time(, or to sadly fall), but not to respond exactly like a decimal whole number of unitary quality; so A€ also has angle of 90 degrees, despite being a whole number. R=>L symmetry states that with infinite number of apples and all their physics, to map this number octave up, a non-fractalized version of apple with all the physical laws would appear if we can describe the system at all (and we can, in theory, with not much more operations than knowing the apples), but this is an _accelerated apple_. For example if all the particles vibrate in their small way, the whole system vibrates as well - while 0=1, which means that R maps to T and vibrations on two octaves point more or less to the same actual thing and map to be equal; by theorems of incompleteness in space and time, they rather _interact_ and _keep their own frequential properties_, and there is the hologram nature - this is the physical condition of such mathematical ideal; for example sound in octaves, which are also not infinite, duplicate such properties of symmetries, but they *do not* do this momentally and precisely, but rather each part of the hologram is incomplete; without theorem of incompleteness, thus we cannot even state that T=R or 0=1, but within Theorem of Incompleteness we state the two, where the latter is strongly and the first theorem is weakly _incomplete_: while it's impossible to avoid it's effects, we rather need to separate those things, for example our cause is not directly us, even if it's a frequency of the same thing, coming from the same place and heading to the same place, and numerically equal - it rather *does* this over time by incompleteness of such theorem, and does not appear *presicely* to allow us to see, for example, that by producing a note in one octave it would non-locally appear in another octave in the same shape - rather, the mathematical tension resolves into having it slowly unfolding in the other frequency or octave; when incompleteness is our theorem space *we don't state this imperfection or incompleteness separately, but it's the simplification of our logical space*, "with noise left out" as you could state this. I am very interested in mathematical systems, which converge to their values, where you can see the theorem in recurring conditions and impossibilities of completely breaking it, while there can be physical interaction instead of immediate mathematical effect - here, simple mathematical theorem is trivial in local solution, but more and more complex in complex system like physics, appearing rather chaotically and not through a single effect or condition, and competing with other theorems and lack of resolved theorem states, such as systems in "final evolutionary equilibrum" - while, in evolution we follow some theorems, which would define "fit", and we do this in quite stable manner, without incompleteness "fit" would be immediately there - in such case we would state that in our system there is "no fit" at all, and no theorem. This in mind, I wrote R=T and 0=1, which are very supportive theorems to make sense of Laegna mathematics, even if the condition of the theorem is complex, for example we can express R and T separately; but we cannot do this completely: you cannot say you stand still in a car, which is moving, even if you can separate T speed of you, and R speed of the car, and that basically acceleration of either one, by equal degree, has equal numeric value in regards to your position - whether you start running in a ship, or the ship itself speeds up, is not detected by your GPS without additional information, which is R=T, but it holds deeply in complex logecs systems, not only in physics. We say that R angles are rather outside, T angles are rather inside; and R is also an union of Z and Y where you would not see very well, whether all particles of your body are moving further by quantum laws or the boat is moving equally further - given you won't die, the effect would be the same, movement without you moving in your frequential scope (I don't know this probably wont happen in physics, but it often happens in math).

### __Infinity by Frequential Coordinates__:

_Second Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Spatial Correspondence Theorem of Infinities__: By adding an exponential factor, especially one of the symmetric multipliers of Laegna system (but classical exponent is a good fit for at least a subset); for example we might measure an _acceleration of distance_ instead of distance between the points, we reach __spatial windows__ able to see infinities. For example imagine having 10 digits from 0 to 9 (you can replace this with 4 digits in some future schoolbook of specifically Laegna, but let's start from classics here, where we cannot say we have the theorem directly in number form): you can convert 0.(9), a number with infinite period of digits under one, into an equation, which takes the number "9" and the range "0-9" as input, and it would return "1" as it's result. While in decimal system you cannot have digit value "10" or "A" (hex digit), you could use the digit "A" and reformulate your structure without altering "0-9" range. This is allowed in Laegna, for example using "Í" as next digit from "E", or writing [EA] instead of E or AE, or by using space "E A" etc.; if you do this in decimal system, and you need the classical equation to limit the window size, you would get, by _limit_, a value +inf, which starts from that point and will not change. "+inf" is a probability function for any such point.

__Exponential Space of Infinities__: @__Spatial Correspondence Theorem of Infinities__; we measure infinities inside spaces with linear-exponential coordinates, for example projecting a matrix, which appears accelerated; we can do this if our numbers allow for it. We can call this an "exponential space" or "accelerated space".

__Accelerated Space of Infinities__: @__Spatial Correspondence Theorem of Infinities__.

### __Geometric Theorems of Infinity__:
Three main theorems of projective infinity to resolve projective geometry.

_Geometric Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Existence of Geometrically Relative Infinities__: Where you map line as infinite number of points, it does not contradict to have measurable concrete relations between lengths of the lines, while this contradicts if you cannot map all the values of infinity to the line (indeed, you might need to resolve additional number complexities and infinite number of digits to resolve __Information Complexity Theorem__, or your numbers are distorted). There is not theoretical problem with assumption that those points all appear on single line given that mathematically, it's an ideal line and not depending on it's coordinate system, while the additional points _might not be visible_, similarly to invisible ranges of light, which exist above infinity and below zero in regards to sensibly mapping the human vision (in regards to it's properties). The theorem involves that mathematical relation exists of zero and one, or one and infinity (from two sides of the thing, where we measure the infinity relations) and that we need either letters Z and X, or respectively X and Y to have mathematical description of this - we need several octaves of projection.

_First Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __(size of, related to infinity) Acceleration Curve Angles__: where the change of velocity, especially the value, is _discrete_, such as switch from 0 to 1 (often needed in computing science); while tangent of such value is clear, the value itself is not. You can see that while tangent is changing smoothly, the actual value of velocity curve (you switch between velocity and acceleration with differential and integral) is impossible in finite space. Geometric property is resolve by the acceleration curve can here pass different distances _straight up or down_, where your functions are rather impossible unless there is _at least a little angle forward_; you could use +inf and -inf, but they would by definition just jump to +inf and -inf, or provide you with unknown about the actual value - which is the case. You need to measure these angles one octave up; while the forward-values are written with numbers like X10, these values are upwards Y10 and downwards Z10, where 10 is to be replaced with value, but X Y and Z relate like whole number octaves in given system.

_Second Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __(size of, related to infinity) Point and curve angles__: Where point angles are strict, they have actual degree. Curved angles are different: we don't know, where the property comes from, that when we resize the system, unlike point angle, a curved angle would change the angle at every point - this is rather a relative change and it's the change used in first Projective theorem of infinities. For a point angle, there exists a curved angle at point of curve, which is one octave down compared to point angle; differences of angles of a circle with different sizes can be measured by coordinate systems - the point would converge at different "zeroness" levels in regards to the circle, which is the *relativity* property of the united proof.

_Third Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __(size of, related to infinity) Smaller and bigger dimensional Spaces__: Where segment of line, say 1cm, has infinity of points, the length of the line is known. For a square of the same size, 1cm*1cm, the length of the line containing same number of points is not numerically known - instead it's known in square units. Thus, points in 1cm times points in 1cm does not yield a finite number, but instead a finite number of *square space*, similarly to _second projective theorem of infinities_, where you need exponential space - square space, by multiplication being acceleration or exponential function (function with exponential, non-linear properties), means that X10*inf, such as XE, times X 10*inf, such as XE, would equal to X^2 10*inf or respectively XEE in octave 1 and X^2E in regards to the same value in octave 0. We denote this by Y(10\*inf * 10\*inf) or YEE within such representation of Y, or we say that 0.5 cm * 0.5 cm = 0.25 cm^2, and 0.5 units * 0.5 units = 0.25 square units. Indeed, we see that with this operation, when we compare values 0.5^2 and 2^2, we have the information loss 4 times - this is the loss of numeric values, where 0.25 is not trivially what you get with infinite number of 0.5's, as it would happen projecting to such space. Indeed, in Laegna system, we could double the number of digits after comma (using R=R\*2, where multiplication of number with itself is equal to adding it's R to itself, resulting number can be deduced from 2R, knowing the R, such as number of digits or positions in a number; by multiplying R with 2, we do not lose information when doing multiplication; adding two equal numbers just adds o to R - sometimes I don't use O for -1, but o for 1/2 as this is the angular value we get and when numbers are defined by angular values, you don't necessarily use another number getting the same angular value in another dimension, such as the number system expanded by dimensionality coming from infinite calculus; you can find out that values inside positive U have frequential mapping to negative numbers, forming the same system of angles and degrees, so in Laegna O can denote 1/2, whereas E can denote 1\\2, half way to upwards inversion - indeed we find many more symmetries later, but I'm not a big fan of non-whole number notations, in a degree I don't like irrational numbers). So, where segment of a line maps to X, the square having the same length of an edge would map to Y.

> Geometric mapping to infinities, thus, allows us to actually see X and Y symmetries, and symmetries with Z, geometrically on paper.

__Projective Geometry__: This is a science to do operations of math with geometric shapes, using the symmetries of geometric relations and really what you can do with tools like the ones symbolic to Freemasons; you can find math solutions just by playing with circles, lines, horizontals etc. While perhaps it's not a lots of math, but it also relates to infinity: for example that all the lines going in parallel directions would meet in infinity, with limit value of their positional difference being zero compared to direction - while, using Y, you could measure them again, it's still an important theorem for many properties, for example for two companies growing by constant acceleration factor, somewhere in infinity they would differ by 10 euros, having infinite amount of euros both, and this would be number zero in our normal frequential zone - indeed, for us the zero difference is not necessarily inexistent, rather we would use something like Y1 + X10 to say that it's one infinity plus 10 euros vs Y1, just one infinity; indeed, if we draw it in geometric space, we get them meeting - and projective geometry has some of it's own axioms related to their presence in regards to drawing; the theorem is used for perspective drawing, for example, where each parallel line meets in a point, and thus we do heavy calculation without computer. Here, these three theorems are basically theorems for projective geometry to find out about infinities with pencil and the paper, and some measurements perhaps but _topology_ of shapes would even avoid the measurements and let us do some precise math with free drawings, where we don't care much about every single numeric value, but rather the appearance of properties in trivial or accessible form, depending on your intelligence factor, such as IQ or EQ or some kind of PQ, the painting quality.

### __Infinity mapping__:
Methods to map the infinity into a finite function space.

#### __Infinite fractal topology__:
Theorems of mapping zeroes also hold: where Y to X is a fractal, Z to X or vice versa are also fractals.

##### __First Finite Theorem of Infinity__, of Continuous Fractal Mapping:

_Mapping from Y to X by continuous fractal topology_, __Fractal Mapping of Infinities__: __Topology of a fractal__ removes the repetition, giving a shape, which is fractally equal (the same fractal), but contains only one branch. __Continuous fractal__ is the one, which does not form discrete fractal branches repeating, but is rather "non-repetitive" in sense that it's fractal property holds in any point. For example, exponent function, at every point, has the same exponent symmetries of the relation of every point below, and the relation of every point above, with any other given point on the function - this means, the fractal property of repeating the same thing, from smaller to bigger, holds in exponential functions when you have exponential multipliers for measure. While from I to E, we can track concrete values on rounded places, to round infinity we cannot take limit to the point, where some last differences might not matter, in continuous basis that they are very similar to other points around; in infinity, we don't find this directly, but fractal topology helps us: if the V, the outside center of the fractal, is to be mapped to concrete function, it is equal to the infinitely repeating property. For example, an infinite line is a continuous fractal: whatever point you take as a "center", whatever number you multiply or divide it with, the line is the same - which is the fractal property. Topology of this fractal is that at infinity, where any point is equal by our mapping, we do not care which point it is but resolve it with U-like properties of V. Mapping finity to A-zone, infinity to E-zone, thus getting the positive numbers up to two, and negative numbers down to minus two, we can map whole infinity into visible function in 4*4 square.

##### __Second Finite Theorem of Infinity__, of Discrete Space Mapping:

_Discrete Space Mapping_: space under 1 is distorted, as we need squared units; mapping infinities to discrete numbers, such as 1 and 2, allows to create spaces, where infinities have fixed size and are not dynamically changing their relations. For example, if given infinity is in relation "2", multiplying it with itself gives "4", which has only proper relations in this whole number (discrete) space; while, in continuous space, it would be disturbed by fact that it relates, proportionally, to 0.5 times 0.5 as 0.25, which can only be used to describe deccelerating spaces, but not for continuous function of position infinities; R!=T in this case, reversing the number axe both below 1 for multiplication and division, and below 0 for addition and subtraction.

##### __First Relational Theorem of Infinity__, of Relational Space Mapping:

_Relational mapping of functional properties_, __Relational Mapping of Infinite Functions__: Here, we do not map variables like a and b only, but we separately map symmetries like mapping each a + b, a - b, a * b and a / b separately, and counting with each one separately in regards to the infinity map, where we map infinity into EIIE (EI-IE is the ranges E to I and I to E, i.e. from negative to positive range continuously, which is a Laegnaish form to say 4*4 square with zero at the middle, using Laegna theorem rules of common math notation and speech while resolving this numerically might be harder); this kind of mapping gives us many instances where numbers directly seem to be lost in infinity, without any clear value symmetry - but given these symmetries, the values are not lost. This also helps in previous method, to map with topofractal.

##### __Second Relational Theorem of Infinity__, of Non-Relational Space Mapping:

__Mapping of Unrelated Infinities__: where we have two separate functions A and B, contained in programming or math blocks, which are supposed to calculate something infinitely, the normal symmetries do not always hold - while we get some numeric values, the *relation* is lost. Thus, if function A is of unit a, function B of unit b, for example A a * B b is definitely A * B a * b; but we dont know about unit a*b while a and b might be well-known. We need the property that with these numbers, if we do all math without knowing the types, we rather succeed, because we have the information densities of the numbers in both, and those have information value, so we can use the results like a normal mapping, where the unbound spaces still interact by being heads-up (correct values for I, O, A, E in terms of mapping to ponegatives) and having mathematical correlations. Where the functions interact, we connect the specific properties, using U's where we don't know - for example, fractally, certain things like 3-digit periods in numbers might map all the operations, where the relative positions of them are not known; if two functions are to be resolved separately, they are unbound values and rather than looking at them separately, we can count on this variable space, which does the operations not caring about not knowing the relation(_-al mapping_).

## Terms

### @Basic Terms:

__Laegna__: _Laegna Mathematical Theory_ is how this Theory is Called.

__Ponegative__: _Ponegative value_ is the one, which is optimizing in regards to it's Taú sensitive value.

__Ponegation__: _Ponegation_

__Taú__: that Truth can change and form valid opposite, equally important if not equally True, even having Equal Rights in sense that the values actually matter and the less known values live along with the known values. When we do or do not change our values and coordinate spaces, the Truth as represented in the Machine must not be static in neither it's value (T) or the value of the value (R), the latter defined in our general value measurements and the first in our specific value measurements of particulars. We assign yin and yang at it, where yin (the white with the black circle, or the blue with the red circle in Laegna Y-colors, which map T to underlying reality) is the T value, and yang (the black with the white circle, or the yellow with green circle inside); this can mean how energy flows through the space in regards of conflict between local (time-based, where we have variables) or global (space-assigned) values, where the coordinate system is operating and variable, because yang would broke at Heaven, the last line (last could be the upper, extra / external line, and this is the theorem of I Ching: when extreme good is reached in excess, it break and forms the worst situation, which holds in automata (the material process) and logecs / imaginative (the _spiritual_, _mental_ process of Z or I, the pre-materialization, where intellect and _creativity_ is _assigned_) by _science_ and _religion_, the _logecs_ and _magic_).

### @Fundamental Terms:

__Magic__: The mental value unknown to Logecs (thus Mystical) the Mind is calculating; _reachable_ in infinity math, by it's _meaning_.
__Mind__: Hidden magic of the __Mind__. R value projection to T, in regards to it's R and T values with their projection (<=> form of function and it's theoretical value or the __ideal__ in sense of how theoretical value is defined, given that it creates an Optimizing Space and thus a Position, vs. positive, which is just a value approaching to it by machine logic or pointing to it by it's Truth Value: either True or False). __Mind__ is defined by the statement that we can measure the values of __L__ (the Left) in the same space with __R__, and that this is the ideal optimization of their space (thus an optimization space balanced distribution, in other words an evolutionary goal, theoretical value).

__Reachable__: what is optimizable indefinitely, is Position if the optimizer is guaranteed to work with reasonable _performance_ and _efficiency_. We avoid __Gold Rush__, the _Ideal Truth Values_, and each variable containing infinity in Octave-Zero, is applied _new digits to the end_, where all digits are _small caps_ in initial set, meaning they get more precise downwards or exist in Space; operations are specified the same way with low-octave operators; given is that capitalization denotes sign of the polar frequency. The operations with infinite digits in any finite measure converges in infinity, so we add to digits and generalize them and keep our database to the end of time, where both the problem and the solution are optimized. Then we say that we _eternally_ executed the calculation, when we got the guarantee we got the Position value; unlike Binary it won't get confused by the _ideal_ position vs. the _practical_ value. Binary disposition can exist on imaginary axe, but we live, and our mathematics of real numbers (in Laegna Math, this also denotes objects in reality, we call it T which is non-imaginative, and associate with objects of group T in reality and imagination of T with dot under it, denoting unknown i.e. space where in personal space exist T and R as options or equally true values, another interpretation of dot accent, i.e. U-accent, the belonging to Uneton Truth Value Space; as we did not use any letter or markup for which U is represented, either unknown, random or undefined gives us that either both, none or one of the values are met with this scope, but not other values - none is the lowest frequency equality, where the fact of specifically the same object of value missing is considered to be it's own value, for example by starting the optimizer and having the optimization in Cause, the value _materializing_).

__The Cause__: Real determinant of the system, at Z; where the __Reason__ is the understanding of detarminant at X; and the __Goal__: is the Y projection of X (X=>Y form of function), where the __Mission__ is the Y projection of Z (Z=>Y form of function thesis or theoretical, ideal value).

__Infinity__: in Mathematecs, the infinite value, while in Logecs, the _actual determinant_, while in Systems, it's the Final Value (by which you make finite mapping in simulations, according to model of Trial and Error or experiment), while in Life it's the _meaning_ and determined by experience.

__Closed System__: Mapping of an index is closed, so that if it's not in an index of Class X, by the division of this index, it also does not belong to Class X. This is mapping to binary logic, but rather to Den, where distinction between R and T is hidden from the measurement as the convergence is simply the value when the simulation exits. Such simulations, then, themselves can be _biased_, so the R axe exists outside, because otherwise it's logical (tautology of Laegna: it's not logical; whereas we use the word "logical" to denote approaching to it and use it in 50:50% proportion in language to denote AA, the position, or 100%:0% proportion in specific, theoretical statement of Truth).

__Open System__: the Logecs value can be __Neglect__-ed, which means it's optimized even afterwards, for example targeting success of your partner or their failure of the same competitor afterwards based on the actual outcome of the contract; whether you was betrayed, it was a competition and you optimize the resulting balance by excluding the implications and doing one deduction operation, or you was _served_ and the outcome was positive; in regards to who you did not make a contract with, they can be _neutral_, denoted by V - we leave it open whether they would have betrayed or served us on R=A on real axe T or time, and we leave it also open whether they would have made the contract or left neutrally or destructively, where the optimization is different - despite not having an experience, we consider them either friends or enemies in imaginary number space, which denotes mapping to considerations, which do not appear, to implications of actual aquintainces, which do appear and thus are on real number axe. Consider that with infinite complexity of a "number", such as knots in Laegna Number System, you map the real objects into number space based on reasonably symmetric coordinate axes, such as form, texture or distribution, where they form 48 (value in space 48) or __identity mapping__.

### @Mentality terms:

_R of Life_, __Mind__: This is how you map in R space of flat reality, vs. the T space of local coordinates; it's also the determinant, which exists in such space at (fractal) Z coordinates and causes you, much like a mathematical theorem, considering whole mathematical space, causes the implication, which is available with local variables, conditions and goals.

_T of Life_, __Self__: This is the actual dimension of you as a system in dynamics with the reality, the bigger system, mapped to T in the same way as __Mind__ maps into R, using the same numbers. For example, where mind has Cause of particular a, the __Self__ has intent to reach A or such tendency. It does not depend if you know the __Self__ or __Mind__, for them to exist in reality and not in your imagination: the Cause which is causing you, in case you are a product of determinant (Position of this definition) or mistake (Negation of this definition), is the actual Cause of you, where in relation to Whole, Rest and All, and the case that two numbers only equal if they are in Position in Laegna ponegative equations (vs. Laegna logical equations), the Cause equals Cause if the determinant is the actual condition, which later becomes an intent; in such case it would not be cancelled out or made low-priority in the eternity of future and logospatial relations.

_E of Life_, _Persona_, __Person__: The material mapping of you, vs. the Self and Mind being rather in Causal and Intellectual axes, which might or might not have effect, integrate to each other or materialize the coordinate system mappings properly; even if this is the _meaning_ of it.

__Meaning__: we use cycular view of reality, where the evolutionary process is kind of "proof", or where the system stabilizes and forms energy efficiency or equilibrum, by _thermodynamics_ and _system theory_ they converge, given that the infinity has enough _positive energy_, which is made by entropy and natural selection of physical compositions, such as forming higher-composition molecules or resolving material states into supporting harmonics of light, sound and logec waves (the latter is webradeon in Laegna Language, forming webradelate). Energy and non-energy (T, the local state) is positive or negative (R, the global state) in Den, which applies kinetic effect or lack of it to T (energy or not), but long-term effect or lack of it to R (position or posetion); so positive energy is at position of actually not being a random fluctuation. Velocity of this energy is fixed by __evolutionary process__, one which necessarily appears in __thermodynamic systems__, and while we cannot state it necessarily converges, we can say failure of converging is an _obstacle_, and the logical condition of the system, with or without intent, is to _resolve_ into harmonic state, especially having strong force to avoid infinities. We associate logical Position of the system of Truth and Falsehood, True and False stats (the __fundation__ or __fundament__, which is the Cause or Intent, vs. the __absolute__, which is the actual flow of the states); we cannot say that the system _remains_ in this energy state, cycle or the fact that the actual result was implied in straightforward way; for example it's not trivial to put a thing in the air - if you measure your energy in regards to your success, you rather avoid putting your important things into an air, not on table or on the floor, for example while you have such energy to put your coffee into an air, you immediately feel the energy is negative: the cup, unlike when being put into the table, will really be where you did put it, but only for a moment as the physical system does not consider this effort, if it's being viewed as a Negative Intent, Z-intent or preliminary value of an intent; rather even another person would stop you in advance if you asked them, so it's also negative in regards to them. We, as biological system, _exercise energy_, but we combine the results with the effort in various ways, trying to keep the results or get rid of them: thus we have the __Whole__, __All__ and the __Rest__, and the __ponegative__.

### @Mathematical Theorems or Definitions:

__48__**__: mapping of space of numbers from 5 to 8, or relatively the R space into common space where T are small numbers and R are big numbers.

__L__: you have flat, equally distributed logical value of every point accross the Space; this maps to Crown chakra in mapping of L and R, or +Infinity. For the mapping, you use same number of digits in same space, but instead of writing 14 or E you would write L14 or LE; if you use different number of digits, you consider that R is different, and thus the unit, whereas for normal mapping to equal number space you consider that R is in equal space and equally ordered, where depending on your method if you do it correctly, the way how the same shapes appear in L as in R space when taking a lower octave of the space infinity (real=O, imag=E, where OA is also space as every negative value on any axe is defined in base math without exceptions, and L must be the unknown value of the space of space, i.e. uncountable in terms that for negative numbers, you can count or "know" the upper part, whereas you can have a Position in both parts; L is counted _from downwards_ and without mapping to R space it becomes an _unbound variable_ with the same mapping of space coordinates to their spaces).

__R__: you have particulars each with their values in local space, such as measurement space, mathematical environment or set of given axioms in theory, vs. the axioms of subsequent theories to optimize towards the values (we call them E values, where E denotes the IE axe, or Y values which appear at the future - both denote positive infinity and on this general level, have aspects to the same values, such as we can map this fundamental property to number axe Íota e, into range of IE, or we can map it to flatness of mathematical space, even infinite R or finite T - space R=>R or R' T [R prim T in our geometric sense where R is a projection and t a projective, they form a space of being the opposites when resolved in R, spatial math or logecs]). For example, if you are human in __R__ space and work for yourself, you are represented as human in __L__ space, being a distinct and induiguishable entity in it's thermodynamic space.

__Den=RT__: One Den has coordinate space of RT, where R and T form the opposition in space, when it has two axes in RT space and maps the locality or globality. The value itself is RT when the spatial coordinate is R, where the temporal coordinate is T - by R=T, the numeric values of those two are the same, while one exists in space and other in time.

__R=T__: R=T, as if you map a coordinate system change or movement of inertial system in a way that without moving, object a would move from position A to position B; the numeric value is equal to it's movement, in regards to it's coordinate system, from position A to position B. Thus, we have to map negative numbers in same direction, and not in opposite direction, to meet R=T. This is opposed in binary math, where the number sign denotes the first (R) binary opposition (it's relation number 1 in scope of Zero and Infinity would map second binary opposition (T)): in math, you have numerically the feeling that when you move in one direction, the space would move in opposite direction: it's not immediately evident that you don't have to do this operation, unless considering it's a very special space; the first implication is that the opposition creates a fractal in your calculation, where polarities appear not only at zero, but in every point which is passed by your calculation; you don't know exact number to get rid of numbers not knowing their directions in regards to one another, for example it's not trivial that when you are moving, looking it from your own perspective, the space is standing still: the exact degree of standing still has negative numbers in calculation in regards to you, which simply don't belong there in such way; indeed we still have some polarity but it exists in obviously different units, for certain calculations. For example, you use complex numbers where space in imaginary units is standing still when you, in real units, are moving - space is your imaginary unit, which affects you "later", where everything outside the scope of calculation is considered "later", as we componentize dimensions of time, and to reach real number positions in one-dimensional space we get them approaching E, from I, because if you already had them they would not be space, but the actual unit in your calculation.
