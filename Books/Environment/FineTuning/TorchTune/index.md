# TorchTune

Our default method perhaps in developer environment, where the user environment might prefer _OpenLLM_. We are scalable about choosing the fine-tuners for different tasks and models.

I prefer __PyTorch__ as it's a standard library: TensorFlow used by HuggingFace is constantly breaking in backwards compability with the books and in future, your own code. We want to use rather what is kind of _settled_, not providing with all kinds of surprise.

Extremely hard to convince CoPilot or ChatGPT I want real download link not some nonsense talk at hugging face cards and their broken-version transformers ..a good old link to just download the tar.gz, not automations and registrations and more libraries ..to just fine-tune with pytorch. I don't understand why they think download links are _useless_ and have this nonsense menthality for providing _advanced_ exception to rules of downloading, as simple as clicking a link and not listing facebook models which want licence clicks.

I am trying to explain it while i have half hours and it has some hugging face bannering and advertizing studion input without accepting most simple requirements: I SAID i want FREE coding models 0.5B and 3.0B, I don't want to see those licences of random unrelated distributors. I want free open source model to train myself I said, and a working link, not different types of clever interfaces to provide something like nonsense around simple links. It's already clear we want tar.gz file no? It needs to exist at this link, simply exist nothing more, and no forms or banners or fancy companies with their advanced downloaders please.
Me: BUT I SAID CHECK THE LINKS!
(I start to think about completely avoiding Hugging Face, because they are really providing a nice and clever interface to their apis, consequently making simple requests work only with proper versions..) Versus somebody, who can just provide lasting links to their models and _directly downloads_.

Again something needed from _transformers_ ..I said I'm DOWNLOADING, like in good old 386 times when it already worked, and not TRANSFORMING or trying to use some advanced database system. I don't like people with problems managing their files - so, continued tomorrow as I get nothing in 1H and the gpts don't want to disable Llama and Facebook because they talk about licences, and Hugging Face with their advanced functionalities: I really don't need advanced functionalities at all, I want to train an AI.

The problem is: people generally like their resources, generally features.

I really want to install packages, not just mere web spiders who never know their own needs - if going to fine-tune, give me the components that's it, I don't have to solve the laws and your complex forms, it's clear I typically need either to fine-tune or run it, not read your interesting cards with download buttons maybe and many parameters not available for search.

(I leave this here, I hope later we have good sources and PyTorch support)

It's still on track with it's favourite products: I looked inside, there is tensorflow code. In the whole book: no tensorflow code. Understand I _did_ select tools.
