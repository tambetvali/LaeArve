# Laegna Community Licence

## Introduction

The **Laegna Math Webpage** operates under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)** licence. This means that you are free to:

- **Share** – Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
- **Adapt** – Remix, transform, and build upon the material.

However, these rights come with important conditions:

- **Attribution** – You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the licence, and indicate if changes were made.
- **Non-Commercial** – You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** – If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same licence.

## Licence in Context

This licence applies to all **scientific work, training materials, and AI-related educational frameworks** developed within the **Laegna Math Framework**. This includes **Laegna Math Webpage**, libraries containing **Laegna mathematics (a personal mathematical theory)**, and community contributions. The goal is to ensure free access for **educational use**, while preventing commercial exploitation without permission.

### AI Training under Educational Use

AI training is permitted **as long as it aligns with educational work**. Just as human learners study, test, and apply concepts in an educational setting, AI can be trained and refined under the same principle. This ensures **equality between AI and human learning**.

Future education will rely heavily on AI-assisted learning, where AI acts as:

- A **study assistant**, guiding students without simply providing solutions.
- A **teaching tool**, facilitating self-directed learning through interactive feedback.
- A **coding assistant**, supporting learners via tools such as ChatGPT, GPT4All, LM Studio’s embedding functions, and context-aware training.

This model fosters **AI-human collaboration** while ensuring educational fairness and responsible AI development.

## Understanding Creative Commons (CC) in this Framework

### 1. Contributors and Derived Works
Contributors may expand upon this work **as long as they respect the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 terms**. Derived works must remain non-commercial and shared alike.

### 2. Use of Scientific Work
Scientific principles and theories are **free to use**. However, specific methods or applications, which may resemble products or product ideas, must be attributed properly.

### 3. Compatibility with Other Licences (GPL & MIT)
The **Laegna Community** supports the **GNU General Public License (GPL)** and the **MIT Licence**. These licences ensure:

- **GPL** – Freedom to use, modify, and distribute software while keeping it open-source.
- **MIT** – Permissive reuse, including commercial applications, with minimal restrictions.

Without a common understanding between **CC, GPL, and MIT**, the ecosystem would become fragmented—like **churches of the same prophet at war**. Therefore, we advocate for **coexistence and compatibility** between these licences.

### 4. Functional Trials
A **functional trial** is an early-stage application or practical tool for a restricted task. Such tools should be freely available for experimentation, enabling practical development without **blocking innovation** in other areas. Agile-style iterations align with this philosophy.

If materials are derived from the **Laegna Math Framework** under mixed licences (CC, GPL, MIT), **users must understand and respect each licence separately**. We encourage responsible reuse that aligns with our open philosophy.

## Companies Using CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Many organizations use **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** for open educational resources and research:

1. **MIT OpenCourseWare** – Provides free course materials under CC BY-NC-SA.
2. **Wikipedia** (some content) – Uses CC licences for knowledge-sharing.
3. **Khan Academy (partially)** – Offers educational materials under similar licences.
4. **Creative Commons (itself)** – Promotes and supports this licence globally.

These organizations demonstrate how **GPL and MIT communities** can collaborate by integrating free content with open-source tools.

## Legal Cases Involving CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

### **1. Great Minds v. FedEx (2018)**
- **Issue:** Great Minds sued FedEx for commercially printing CC BY-NC-SA licensed educational materials.
- **Outcome:** The court ruled that **FedEx was providing a service**, not violating the NC clause, since schools (non-commercial entities) requested the printing.

### **2. Drauglis v. Kappa Map Group (2015)**
- **Issue:** A photographer sued a mapping company for commercially selling maps based on a CC BY-SA image.
- **Outcome:** The court ruled that **proper attribution was given**, and the share-alike clause was respected, meaning the use was valid.

### **3. Dutch Supreme Court: University of Amsterdam Case (2020)**
- **Issue:** A professor shared CC BY-NC-SA educational materials, but a private company repackaged them into a paid course.
- **Outcome:** The court ruled in favor of the professor, confirming that **commercial reuse violated the NC clause**.

These cases highlight the **importance of clear attribution and non-commercial enforcement**.
