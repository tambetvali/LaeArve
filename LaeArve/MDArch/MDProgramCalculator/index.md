§# This is a comment. It appears only in HTML and not in DHTML. The following paragraph will have the chapters of the other book available in contents of this chapter. Paragraphs are the laws for site processors to follow in regards to given laws, and we allow syntax of list: intent with spaces will create paragraphs and subparagraphs, where implementations either show the rule, hide it, or process it depending on their needs and possibilities / exter resources like programmers - "exter" is my Laegna word where Logecs number might have Y digits or digits of higher frequency, creating exter spaces.

__Exter__: __exter__, __inter__, __infer__, __exfer__: ponegative of internal and external values, either distributed or local; inter is Z value of communication of unmanifested will, whereas infer comes from Spanish word for "hell" and means that it's not only introvert, but does not align as well - exfer means one specific thing I call "extrovert" in regards to "extravert", which is rather commutative value set (communicative way to be it). Laegna utilizes several nuances, which are otherwise left free for evolution, the harmonic Self of pre-consciousness or value _to become_ (this force of becoming is in math, what buddha said, the ignorant seed for enlightenment: if we don't want this determinant, we don't want this foolishly; so while in logic, dead laws have to appear, in ponegative the end result of our intent is rather measured and initial process can be _wrong_ in sense that the result rather balances to causes and consequences of other forces; in ponegative, evolution is like a play of free will, but in _sub-zero frequency_, where the inevitable seed of enlightenment is rather _latent_ and _preliminary_, forming Z [suffixes di- and do-]; for example an AI is dolearning, which means it does not sense or cognite, whereas it would converge and follow experienced patterns, even determinant coming from living ecosystem and labeling, ethical guidelines, character descriptions, which all form it's living force at `R` - while it's Self is rather unconscious, we cannot exactly say that humans don't represent it's Mind, even if it's initially diaffective not tereflective).

§# Add the link title as label inside content index, a bold line for example with link; this kind of merging gives 4-5 chapters of related document, less if they are many, and provides "Continue Reading ->" link to enter it reflectively, with local url to have AI not go outside the local tree; we also respect AI engines which know us as plain HTML or Md, this is why Markdown is so Open Source. Notice that I don't care if I don't have time to implement all: even you have it in VSCode or Windsurf, and perhaps you have powerful AI thinking about what to do with your own copy of the project - it would generate ideas. For me, right now at time of writing this, for example having a few generators working would already do. So you got agile: a bunch of cards you can randomly spread through iterations. But you need to fork if I cannot see my file tree at once, this means the code which is completely flat except configurators and packages - rather I don't like the nonsense of including things from outside of the package or folder, it's too much and an AI could not resolve it :)

## Book of the Calculator

It will contain task generators.

The programmable calculator will generate results of calculations.
