# Laegna Math Coder

Coder is a mathematical representation of a Programming Language, where it does not have initial input about syntax, code files and their library dependencies.

The interface for the Coder:
- Typical Programming IDE of It's Own Time
- One can modify structured approach to Data
- One can assign execution tracks to Data, based on it's Syntax and Semantics

I use many capitals because the introduction part is itself Capital: it's where the _main cityzens_ (view "cityzen" in programming context from dictionary, especially figure out what means "major cityzen" or "junior cityzen", or then a "thief" in programming context of data and it's execution tracks, including the feedback to the execution tracks into trial and error: Based on [Theorem of Incompletness][1]).

## Syntax and Language Semantics

Some typical syntax exists, which is used when not stating othewise; rather, it's a common set of unified values, which can do in any programming language.

Since the syntax and semantics share valuable resources: 3 types of braces, a couple of numbers and little more of letters, some punctuation marks and operators, and symbols to structure a sentence - within this, in different scopes of programming, such as logical or imperative, and different domains of programming, such as chemical component calculator - perhaps from all the operators a simple implementation has only plus, to combine the chemicals, and braces to form a structure, and it could inherently deduce which structure those compounds would take; still you might want programming capabilities such as showing and hiding the views, choosing a structure, which fits your needs and executing different chemical tests, such as whether your compound would burn or melt - advanced C++ templates and operators could be annoying on your way, because maybe you want to use "!" for H2O and ";" for separating distinct structures on the same line, even inside a compound, not to end a sentence. PovRay, for example, is kind of cool "programming language" in sense that you can program in it - but like many domain specific languages, it takes constructs like "if", "plus", "variable" in their standard senses and turns the syntax absolutely long and hard to use - because for all the operators, it needs them in 3D object representation, which would look ugly if all your keyboard is only able to write the code logic; rather, if you have a lot of code logic, you can integrate PovRay with python or generate the model in C++ programming in DirectX or OpenGL for preview, so that you get the shape, and then convert it into PovRay to have proper reflections, more advanced transparency and more from pure Raytracing (in the future it's probably different, video card would do realtime raytracing, but perhaps a computer would use classical 3D rendering to grasp millions of images of the same object under different conditions into it's primitive command, such as "LooksAlwaysSimilar(object, similarityDegree)", which would render the views very fast and check whether it's generally "similar", not some advanced reflection effect and not even for human to prevision; then the computer would rather learn by AI to understand the real-world or advanced rendering and human cognition to verify, based on simplified view or even wireframe, whether the object would appear similar to human in invariant positioning, lighting and rotations or even tilt - I think tilt somehow accidentially happened into context of matrices, so perhaps you are not interested in invariance when tilting, it's rather side-effect of manipulating object coming into 3D graphics from more general math, where it's rather simple symmetry and thus not meaningless in complete sense even if it compares with other random things such as twist).

So we do:
- Some basic syntax, because all around the Laegna Programming Language an user and computer or AI should easily understand the code, not learning the local dialect very carefully, and there should be no contra-intuition or very incoherent things, like a business program, which uses minus instead of plus in one, rather critical position with special notation, and uses plus in everywhere else.
