# Numeric ranges

The range of numbers is `18` in their length, and `HK` in their dimension - the numbers 1 to 8 have longest length, while the matrix of 4*4 has the biggest dimensionality - we measure this in information density, which is equal in each digit value, an effect I will describe otherwere in plain math and tautologies.

18:

1-4 are the inner space, and 5-8 the outer space values, so that at 8, the limit of infinity would collapse to zero and we get eternal field of infinity.

We see the dimension of `18` has three bits:
- T: The actual, present value
- R: The infinite, final value
- H: The scope mapping

Notice the case:

0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

2 * 2 = 4

In regards to 1, these are equal, but they are based on polarity - on the same line, it's not so visible how, by the same operator, we first divide and then multiply. This way, dividers and multipliers do weird things, a real-complex axe opposition where complex part is reversed; while we can do Laegna Binary / Laegna Latin oppositions like that, we have to define them (especially in this text, where we use Latin operators for Laegna operations - Laegna operations themselves have 12 normal values like each Laegna letter and normally they don't invert anything, while decimal operators have 6 values and subsequently, not enough space of operation to avoid this carelessly, rather we emulate that).

The given relation constitutes a paradox:
* We don't really have operators to describe what actually happens with square, whose side length is x. Given we must not mention dimensions, indeed square sized 0.5 units must be inverse square, with negative volume in regards to it's side length.

We can see, an important axe comes to play: we have addictives and the population already in play, but now we have ether.

In ether, nothing moves: but it does not stand still.

We see another axe, which goes backwards between (inter) -1 and 1 (signed `OA` range), and forewards exter it. We see that the amount we are able to move it here is 1 / 2 of it's value range; thus we get another digit H, which either neutralizes such change or doubles it. We read each position in regards of whether it's more than 4 or less than 5 (more or less than `4` to use that Laegna exception of counting, that limit value of 4 is _more precise_, when it equals^2 to itself in comparison than 5 equals itself; we zoom into 5 to reach that precision - given that we are somehow inclined to rather real number axe); for example given `285442`, we get H Den (haden) of `OAAOOO`, which means such change in infinity. Here, it might seem that we use superinfinities really with 1/4 precision in regards to the number, counting the digits and combinatorics of their interactions in simplified space; we rather have 4 components of the number, where non-capitalized letters are the `A` component and this is mostly what we use; we have large-non-caps, large, small and finally small-caps connecting V or the outside-circle. We use equal number of digits in each 4 components to extend our vision to infinity - we cannot do more, as I said the God's chakra is 1/4 of exter space above crown chakra, by which I mean we cannot approach infinity very much with local values.

Complex number:
- Ten, 1-4, is having one frequency band.
- Tene, 1-8 is having two.
- Tenet, the complex number, has two 1-4 axes and thus, the two components interact.
- Sometimes we write 1-4 or 1-8 in two number groups; notice that R and T connect to give *infinity and /infinity (laegna has 4 signs) rather the whole Ten values; we sometimes map this to U and V accents above and below: rather unknown, they move the number up and down, as they are related to position and negation, not just neutrally unknown; this is their two-accent or base-4 accent value, while if we conider only accents above, we have base-2 and this is not sign-oriented in nature.
  - This R and T group is otherwise like complex number, but without one limitation: the same position, like R, is then considered with two letters ÍÍ, a rare and ambiguous use of I but useful to notice: we got UÍ and ÍU, thus we have _abstracts_ of both components, being able to discriminate between real and imaginary, when they are actually contained within one number value; additionally, we can relate more to components R and T of two-digit complex, than with one digit.

Contemplate over those dimensions: each of them appears in our normal operations, where for example we divide matrix into components, but then treat it's overall effect envisioning it as a vector.
