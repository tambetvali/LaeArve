# Matrix and Vector functions

We cannot understand Matrix and Vector multiplications, following KISS - rather, by Knowing the Good and Bad, or knowing to know, we would lose the connection with reality.

These are functions:
- Matrix
- Vector
- Number

Hereby, an AI model is a function.

Matrix a.
b = a(x).

Matrix a is created, and with balanced order of all operands in x, a and b (autotranspose), we use their properties:
- Rows and columns of a Matrix represent input and output variables, where they fit function I/O, input and output layers of a model etc.
- Functions, given the function itself, some of it's inputs and outputs are either contextual variables or constants, will change and keep the parameters. AI can be teached like this: to feed model m some variables a and b and check the result in c, we call "(?a, ?b)m = c", where the model would know that with this input the value will be c. AI would resolve if we start to correct static functions and matrices, or they would react to their tensors (`I` and `E`, the frequency of the function or matrix variable assignment is low). We optimize and this means, we never carry many variables: given each variable a combinatoric space, if it does not fit it's exponential factor in O-notation, this would be responded in advance (when O-notation is known) or by run-time correction (when it spends resources to calculate it's resource need or run it's operations, in first case it lacks _karma_ - including the resources as absolute and needs as fundamental _karma_ - and is not ran). AI will do random distribution in range and scope of these and ponegate would be more into projections, illusions, and the realm of Maya. Matrix is 2-dimensional and thus maps to complex axe, because information density is RÂ²; given this, it's a normal multiplication of two numbers, more or less - when you look from the right end of the time.
- Vectors, when used as functions, will do also multiplication of their numeric value, even if multicomponent or nested, but in R space of real axe / time.
- Numbers, then, scale and they are Dens in regards to vectors and matrices: if they have only one component, they do their operation on the whole space of components, such as for a*d, which is a two-dimensional value, the square of the number (two dimensions) would change the result, but also those two variables change proportionally.
