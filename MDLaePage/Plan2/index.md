# Plan2

Initially I called this iteration 1 in my try to make it simpler.

I think Cascade still got the "Other approach" of now making it more user-friendly as this is too much.

I moved our conversation also here into subfolder "MDGenDocs" - despite I want to keep this, because in era of AI's it's even especially important to keep textual data along with your project, even if it gets updated.

I now want to do what I call iteration Zero, to create a balanced document. I copy some code from around and create the vision, which would work - indeed, I have this evening left and tomorrow is no-design-day of technical approach. I will also add some books here for Cascade to read as it should enjoy more my scientific approach.
