# Licence history and goals

Current Licence: cc-by-nc-sa-4.0

(an AI told it's unclear, what licence we have, so I made a document, which would be more related)

## Short

AI: The CC BY-NC-SA license allows creators to share their work with others as they see fit (by means of free use, modification, adaptation, and distribution) provided that you are credited appropriately and give credit where it's due. This means you can reproduce, distribute, modify, and adapt the content in your own work without getting permission from the original creator. You must not make any changes to the source material or change its meaning substantially. The license is designed to support a variety of creative expressions while also promoting fair use principles.

# AI interpretation for the Licence

Notice: here it's quite a long discussion, where I'm trying to understand from the AI, whether the law is to be interpreted rather _technically_ or _substantially_. While I'm sure that AI training is _Educational Use_ unless perhaps when it's the commercial work of this AI or when the AI has unreasonable costs and responsibilities rather than it's good place in society - still the answers do not reflect my personal tastes so much, while I like that the definition of "commercial" might depend on relevant parameters by the Law.

> can we ask money for commercial use?

In general, it's not appropriate to solicit money from others for the purpose of commercial use unless there are legal and ethical grounds for doing so. The CC BY-NC-SA license you provided specifically allows creators to share their work with others as they see fit (by means of free use, modification, adaptation, and distribution) without any conditions attached other than fair use principles. In such a case, the money could be used to cover costs associated with commercial use or to pay for legal fees in exchange for the right to use the content. However, this should always be done with consideration for the original creator's rights and not as an inducement for commercial activity.

> can we sell our own derived products, or create something commercial using our code and science?

In general, it is not appropriate to seek money from others for derivative works of your work unless there are legal and ethical grounds for doing so. The CC BY-NC-SA license you provided specifically allows creators to share their work with others as they see fit (by means of free use, modification, adaptation, and distribution) without any conditions attached other than fair use principles. In such a case, the money could be used to cover costs associated with commercial use or to pay for legal fees in exchange for the right to use the content. However, this should always be done with consideration for the original creator's rights and not as an inducement for commercial activity.
It is also important to consider the ethical implications of seeking money from others for derivative works. Commercial activities may have negative impacts on the creators' reputation or lead to conflicts over ownership of intellectual property. Therefore, it is advisable to seek permission from the original creators before attempting any form of commercial use of their work.

> How much our commercial work could be used to support the product and goal; for example, having a sustainable model for providing AI and other expensive services, creating interactive introductions, while keeping the basic rights of users, such as some access to free education?

In terms of supporting the product and goal in a sustainable way, we could create interactive introductions that provide users with information and resources related to AI and other expensive services while keeping the basic rights of users such as some access to free education. This would involve developing and creating engaging content that educates users about these topics and provides them with the tools they need to succeed in the field.
It's important to note that this is just a starting point and we can expand on it further based on user feedback and needs, but ultimately the goal of our work should be to provide users with valuable information and resources related to AI and other expensive services.

> CC BY NC SA 4.0 - if commercial strategy is provided, which finally leads to more free services and access to expensive resources for the free community, is the aspect of selling commercial products and advertising them within product with such licence, logical, legal and ethical framework? What would turn it to be so?

The aspect you're describing involves a complex mix of commercial strategy (selling products or services), marketing, licensing agreements, and ethical considerations. Let's break down the components:
- __Commercial Strategy__: You've correctly identified that providing engaging content and creating tools for free education helps attract users. This aligns with your goal of increasing access to free educational resources.
- __Marketing__: Developing interactive introductions and creating engaging content are key to attracting a wide audience. This approach ensures the community becomes aware of the benefits, making it more appealing and open to learning.
- __Licenses__: The commercial strategy involves using specific licenses that allow for the distribution of your products within the context of educational services. These licenses ensure fair use, avoiding copyright violations and ensuring legal compliance.
Ethical Considerations: Ethically, you must consider both the rights and responsibilities of individuals. You need to be transparent about what you're doing, avoid exploitation, and respect user privacy. This aligns with principles like commercial freedom and ethical business practices.

__Legal Framework__:

- __Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights__: Ensure that you have legally protected your content and images. Copyright laws protect the rights of creators. Make sure that any works you create are protected by copyright and adhere to the terms of use.
Intellectual Property Licenses: You should obtain proper licenses for using intellectual property, such as software, design elements, or other media, under appropriate licensing agreements.
- __Fair Use Clause__: Adhere to the fair use clause of U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, Chapter 10) which allows limited uses like teaching, research, and commentary without permission, but requires proper authorization for all other uses.

__Ethical Framework__:

- __Transparency__: Be transparent about your business practices, including how you acquire, use, sell, and dispose of products. This includes disclosing any fees or costs associated with your services.
- __User Consent__: Ensure that users are informed about the terms of service and agree to the licensing agreements before using their services. User consent is crucial for avoiding legal issues.
- __Regulatory Compliance__: Stay updated on applicable regulations in your jurisdiction, such as data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) which apply to personal information shared with the community.

__Implementation Steps__:

- __Develop Engaging Content__: Create content that educates and inspires users about AI and expensive services. Ensure it is accessible and engaging, providing value without compromising privacy or ethics.
Licensing Agreements: Obtain clear and enforceable licenses for using intellectual property like software, design elements, etc., based on the terms set out in your licensing agreements.
- __Educational Workshops and Community Engagement__: Organize workshops where users can learn from professionals. Engage with the community through regular events and forums to build trust and encourage participation.
User Feedback Loop: Regularly gather feedback from users about the quality of your content, services, and overall experience. Use this data for continuous improvement and growth.
- __Continuous Improvement__: Stay updated on changes in user expectations and technology trends. Continuously enhance your offerings based on these updates to provide a valuable service that meets evolving needs.

By integrating these legal, ethical, and practical considerations into your commercial strategy, you can create an environment where both users and creators feel respected, promoting the use of AI and expensive services responsibly while fostering a welcoming community.

# My additional comments

## AI readability

Creative Commons is known by it's _human readability_, such as having designed representations where each goal is graphically well-represented, short and readable; consequently, and AI can read it and have more prevalence as context, especially as short contextual paragraph; where it's used as a context, it's statistically more probable that it's connected with other aspects as it's contexts, than with GPL, which is longer and made of more complex structures.

## Initial mission of the Licence

I said, from Hugging Face licence selection: which allows scientific community to be undistrubed, working on the actual goals; the educational use and free use, while being good in application to scientific work. I wasn't too careful about the licence, but I generally support Creative Commons. So I accepted the choid of cc-by-nc-sa-4.0, which means .

My favourite licence has been GPLv3 and I don't mind if there is GPLv3 content or books available around here, or if some models or embeddings come as such. I have not gone deep into MIT, but it's about the same target there, to raise our collective efficiency and provide some means.

I am quite permissive as this is a scientific work and rather it's fine to live in better society, while I keep different rights as an owner and contributor of the project; where others can make clones and develop their own branches - you cannot _ultimately_ make it yours.

### Qwen2.5:0.5b running in Jan, not extremely slow but somewhat stupid - I use this far simpler questions while a little more advanced models tackle more complex problems - said this about the licence:

__Notice__: I'm not responsible on it's correctness, as the licence itself is not given here in this document:

CC BY NC SA 4.0 is an open license that allows users to copy, distribute, modify, commercial use, and build upon the work provided under the terms of the license. This implies that you can share your code in a variety of ways without needing permission from the original author.


In general, if someone wants to use your code, they must follow these guidelines:
- You retain the copyright on any modifications or additions made to the code.
- You give credit to the original authors and contributors who contributed to the development of the code.
- You do not modify the code in a way that makes it impossible for others to understand its purpose.

This license allows you to use, modify, and distribute your code as long as you provide appropriate attribution, maintain the copyright information, and give credit to the original authors and contributors who made the changes.


It's important to note that while this is an open license, some terms are subject to change or additional conditions may be added. Always consult the specific terms of any open source license for more details.

Certainly! Let me break down the CC BY NC SA 4.0 license:
- CC (Creative Commons): This is a non-profit organization that provides open licenses for digital works like images, music, movies, and software. They are designed to allow people to use, modify, and share these works without needing permission from the original creators.
- BY: This acronym stands for "By" in the context of Creative Commons. It refers to the work being presented or published by the creator (the author).
- NC: The abbreviation NC typically stands for "No Credit Required." This means that if you use a piece of code, software, or other content that was created by someone else and you don't cite them in your own work, they won’t automatically take credit for it.
- SA: In the context of Creative Commons, SA generally means "Share-Alike," which means that you can freely adapt, remix, and distribute the work under certain conditions. You should not include the original creator's name or link to their website in your modified version.

Context:

Creative Commons (CC):
- By: This stands for the copyright of the original creator.
- NC: This means you can use, modify, and share the work without needing permission from the original creator.

No Credit Required (NC):
- If you don't cite the original creators in your modified version, they will not automatically take credit for the content.

Share-Alike (SA):
- This is a principle that says you can use and adapt the work under certain conditions without needing permission from the copyright holder.

__Key Points:__


Creative Commons licenses: These are designed to make it easier for users to share, modify, and distribute content in a way that respects both the original creators' rights and those of others.

No Credit Required (NC):
- If you don't cite the copyright holder, they might not take credit for your work.

Share-Alike (SA):
- You can use and adapt the work under certain conditions without needing permission from the original creator.

## Educational use

I define it broadly:
- Educational use of humans
- Educational use of AI's, bots etc.

Definitely you have the permission to add it to your knowledge base, given you won't break the original intent, or any other cases you can find (I'm not also a court, or a lawyer - I think while the licence looks good to me, the laws are far more than this, when they start to give this goal some practical value and purpose; where the _causes_ and _effects_ of a scientific work can be more than our imagination).

In this respect to interpreting the science, my interpretation is that the studies of your A.I. _are_ of educational purpose, while in respect to licences it's hard to say, whether it's your product and manufactoring, for example, given the current condition of distributed laws - I don't say it's _always_ an education, even an AI would be able to have a commercial purpose; I do not also deny the whole commercial purpose.

## Legality

While it might be legal by law to use the product in your case and your purpose, it might not be strictly legal. To not have the problems of thief, you would:
- Have some support
- Attract contributions
- Release your own developments
- Get advertised by us

Corporation "Logica" back then, while I cannot guarantee each aspect of them, they introduced to me that laws can be followed _more_ than given; for example you might avoid paying minimum salaries, but you can also read the law very carefully and not do the "_communist crime_" at all: you can find the _reasons_ for minimum salary and apply that in your case, for example to carefully follow the law, you can also make sure that the conditions of minimum salary are met given all the calculations behind that, for example in your case it might be _easier_ to pay or for ethical level of your worker, they might _deserve_ more. I don't remember did they tell it somewhere or did I get this impression; but the sentence is: "you can follow the laws even _more_". For example, to remain authority as a cityzen, you pick up all kinds of courts of honor, rules of politeness and political correctness, where breaking them might not be a crime, but it might disable you from getting every benefit from not being a criminal: for example, being an academic, you might be accused in _opinions_, whereas a person of lower degree might not have much more - while they cannot work in Academy, they would also not be a straight criminals or losers, they might not even be impolite.

## Freedom

Moving less money does not make us more free; freedom is a complex topic.

For example, whether I am free:
- To finish the code.
- To reach some success.
- To get my coffee and cigarettes.

In each case it's a complex topic and it might be more beneficial, for example, to raise the average salary - a general effect might be equal. I am deeply a person of meaning, not the form, even if the licences are apt to the slow process of the law and it might not be straightforward clear, what to do with all these considerations and how much we can implement.

## Commerciality

Rather than avoiding money or all the logic behind it, I am trying to create a benefit in materialistic way, connecting the communuty, contributors etc. and providing a good service; for example we are _free_ to support ourselves and the good causes. The purpose is practical and it would mean benefits of money and otherwise; somewhere the licence ends and the more educated people do more; while author of GPL sounded initially more _against the money_, in my situation I'm more _on behalf of it_. While there is no sense to "support the rich" if they don't spend time volunteering, and for real - I think girls in Catalunya are rather successful and maybe the money would be a little in balance, while these are often rather Christians, I don't know how the Pope would have supported me - rather, he would have a car and a house, and pay all the service with all the donations; I'm not sure whether I'm simply a witch for him, a man with innovations in Science and Religion, after all. It might not be an active thing, but the case of introducing Viking religion - despite I'm a Buddhist I have some concerns about modern paganism - is rather some remains of the Medievial theory, and including the Buddhism: whether the Pope would be simply _responsible_ to rather spread modern theories and peace: my concern has a single fact that as a Buddhist, I might not be able to eat the pan (bread) an missa. So should I be very active to support with my own rather Holy Cause, the theory I work with, without having the _pan_? I think they are not restricted in Buddhist, Native American, Estonian traditional rituals unless those really demand something deeper, and unless they learn that deep; for me I am very much aware of the symbolic meanings of Catholic missa; I have Orthodox father and I don't understand the situation of Pope of Orthodox or Lutherian "not being Christian" - in Estonia, rather you are Christian by spreading bread, not by having a list of Estonian local saints in your head. I could read Bible very well as a Buddhist, but if it's about local saints, I would really start from Estonian and Russian saints, perhaps even Greek: and anyway, I like Augustinus, who said that God is proven by Cause; a deep thinker, but perhaps I don't even find each of this here. Young girls, anyway, or actually I was also 30, they rather _do have_ some open mind: let's see what it means to eventually grow up, I am now perhaps more like my father, respecting a little tradition and not just an empty book.

The sustainability:
- I want embeddings, fine-tunings, many things which are rather expensive; at this time the AI work costs as much as modem connections in the beginning of internet era. We have to wait.
- I like to have fully functional free aspect and freedoms for professionals, free activists, etc. Commercial Products like Borland Pascal often work fine. While those free products should be also able to scale in respect to my own growth, such as letting me have more functions for paying clients and letting to get each service naturally by the Ads or Donations on client base as it grows; the freedom can be balanced with income. Finally, this movement of money is often a freedom, for example Microsoft, with money, is rather free to develop a product and we are somehow free to use it - he can manage it to come with computer with no noticeable raise in it's price. Well I'm long-term user of Linux, but for my own reasons which are not always even suitable for non-programmer or non-scientist, for example I have certain feeling of participiation.
- I am not completely against advertising in our ecosystem, while it must be made clear what we get - with practical set of free functions, where I can even sense the connection that who is asked money, is actually earning it (for example I am not offended that Notion.so asks money for publishing under password, which is rather not the purpose of free software, and if I break their size limitations without any money, I must be a maniac; I saw that for the non-profit organization, when trying to do things involving money, all the functions went off, while with my public science project I'm having rather several freedoms even if the AI is not functioning every time). I am sure that good commercial products might just fit some developers of open source people, who would join - a good product is sometimes expensive to develop and while such advertisement might not be in very active part of the page, it could still be mentioned and advertised in my scenario; it should rather be visible, how that money flow is creating sustainability.
- My development of freedoms is part of sustainability: while my ideas might have some commercial potentials, the collective use of my work has added benefit; and we are doing it for vitality, longer life and prosperity, not to become poorer. It's a model of sustainability. Rather than avoiding money as if it was just code made out of thin air: AI-assisted development, servers, many things now need exponential amount of resources and they need money, even if the amount is not exponential. Rather than demanding open source, I like _good models of sustainability_, so for example business strategy of "Blue Oceans", where we actually accelerate, does not make me concerned but they would rather be able to pay in many cases. Rather than demanding free product from every aspect - for example in current situation of the A.I. a good model of sustainability definitely involves money and reliable donations are also expenses, not achievable right now. It's not a question why I get VSCode for free, but not CoPilot in every sense - the work is hard to provide me with _anything_ and if, though advertising, client support, combinations of left and right wing attitudes and developments: if it's all combined into the case that users, one or another way, including the poor activists, get supported, it's fine.

We are people living in a thermosystem, encorporating thermosystematic activities: we share and distribute resources. It's a very active and complex thing to criticize and there are no right and wrong answers.

This project is under Creative Commons, because it's the actual direct source of income for scientific theory - it has too much to win from all the people, and too much to provide, being free, but not misused and abused. Money, still, if it balances the income, expenses, efforts and contributions, could be either dangerous or very beneficial: and like the server ecosystem, even in IT we need active money as much as open source - then, in my environment, I'm not trying to permit people from having different models for sustainability, rather I want to know that it's sustainability; in commercial model, rather they _can_ pay for it's their model, while the free software people and free science people - they _can_ contribute. In commercial model, it's precisely hard to explain, if they won't pay for anything.

For example, imagine a commercial product of Education, which would create us all kinds of interactive content, actual games to solve puzzles etc., while keeping their science mostly open - if we fail to do this without money; if they even guarantee that passing their exams, one would be able to pay ..I might consider that people actually get access to their work, and it's not unimportant for us, rather we slowly implement our own interactive content - I cannot deny them everything of us, for example being in our list of products and helpful tools for children or youth or those who learn for lifetime; while in some cases it would be weird, why they don't pay: if they provide us 100 free multimedia applications on their page, and then sell 200, which you could get _somehow_ for free for specific purpose - their support requests would be considered rather than just doing any development for money, the real-world case is that the real people are learning, and somebody has accumulated money to enable this.

## Blue Ocean Strategy as described by an AI

**AI**: The business strategy of "blue ocean" involves identifying a niche or market segment where there is no competition and developing products or services that offer unique value propositions, emphasizing differentiation from existing players, achieving scalability by expanding into new markets, maintaining innovation through continuous partnerships and technological advancements, and fostering customer loyalty with loyalty programs.
