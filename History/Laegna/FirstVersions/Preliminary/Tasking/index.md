# For having some knowledge of general methods

Note: this is the first implementation.

Here are some AI-generated answers for parts of the task, where you can see how it's done.

You see which libraries and functions are used to do each subpart.

This alltogether is a simples implementation of AI trainer for Laegna: the one you are going to fork if you want to do it all on your own, but utilize existing examples and code (I often have this ambition).

Well it seems it will be done with CoPilot, even if I would trust ChatGPT for this specific task, but it's offstream and CoPilot should work well to implement against requirements.

## I gave an AI this task to get the introduction

Okay this is the whole implementation, while I have not tested it - also mention it's a lesson and I don't guarantee it's correct in the first place, but it helps to understand the whole idea. In my site I have each question and answer, mention that readers can fix what they see as error or lack of functionality, where I can't. Explain the process: how to use VSCode, github, copilot, to continue the process; what to implement and have and where to make accounts to have all access, also how to use pip and import once they see the errors. Also explain fine-tuning AI's, and how a model would start recognizing patterns related to my mathematics (Laegna math) as it has fine-tuned on cards containing the numbers and relating properly to decimal system so it could see the patterns when I'm implementing more close to their own ideal implementations of my math. The user needs to know that having such tasks, in modern era, they do not need to be programmers, but they need: some knowledge of APIs, programming tools, version control and md files, where they can use AI-generated py files as programs, but still modify them. Also explain how to execute the model with Jan, and mention GPT4All and LM Studio for that purpose, also some web system to have it online with gguf. Represent Visual Studio as a tool, for basic user, which allows to create structured representation of Markdown documentation, incorporate code as programs generated by AI, understanding the API and not the program so well, and version control and share their project; Markdown files could be, for example, easily served as web with Flask and Mistune, where I will have more information on my website. Also explain, carefully, the whole project we made together here: to "teach new math to old AI's" Innovate: make it very engaging to basic user and also to developer.

# Teaching New Math to Old AIs: Project Overview

### **Introduction**

The project we've designed focuses on creating a framework that allows AI models to learn and understand new mathematical systems, like your Laegna Math, through tools like Genanki flashcards and fine-tuning processes. This implementation represents a *lesson*, not a guaranteed final solution, empowering readers to explore, test, and improve it based on their needs and insights.

Your site provides a database of questions and answers that readers can review, fix errors, or expand functionality. By working with these resources, users can gradually refine both the dataset and the AI itself, creating a collaborative environment where AI evolves through shared knowledge. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to continue this process effectively.

### **Using Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Copilot**

#### **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
- **Purpose**: VSCode is a lightweight, powerful code editor that simplifies programming, documentation, and project management. It helps organize Markdown documentation and Python files generated by AI, like the ones we've built here.
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for Python and Markdown.
  - Integration with GitHub for version control.
  - Extensions like AI Copilot to assist with real-time code generation and problem-solving.

#### **GitHub**
- **Purpose**: GitHub acts as your version control platform, allowing you to track project changes, collaborate with others, and share your implementations publicly or privately.
- **How to Use**:
  1. **Create an Account**: Sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  2. **Set Up a Repository**: Store your Python files (`ai_training_with_integer_conversion.py`, `original_converter.py`, `letter_converter.py`, etc.) and Markdown documentation.
  3. **Use Git**: Use Git commands or VSCode's Git extension to push, pull, and commit changes.

#### **AI Copilot**
- **Purpose**: Copilot enhances coding by suggesting solutions, generating code snippets, and offering explanations for complex logic.
- **Usage**:
  - Install Copilot as a VSCode extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
  - Use Copilot to refine code logic, generate missing functions, or create automated documentation.

### **Addressing Errors: Using Pip and Import Statements**
When encountering errors, here's how to tackle them:

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - Use `pip` to install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers torch datasets genanki gguf
     ```
   - If a package fails to import, double-check its installation using `pip show package_name` and reinstall if necessary (`pip install --upgrade package_name`).

2. **Fix Import Errors**:
   - Ensure file paths are correct when importing Python modules (e.g., `original_converter.py` and `letter_converter.py`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     from original_converter import OriginalConverter
     from letter_converter import LetterConverter
     ```

3. **Test Your Code**:
   - Run programs using the terminal or VSCode's debugger. Look for error messages and use them to guide corrections.

### **Fine-Tuning AI Models**

#### **What is Fine-Tuning?**
Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained AI model to your specific needs by training it on custom data. For instance, fine-tuning the AI on flashcards containing Laegna Math patterns helps it understand the relationships between numbers and your unique decimal system.

#### **How Fine-Tuning Works**:
1. **Training Data**:
   - Your dataset of converted questions and answers serves as input for fine-tuning.
   - AI learns from patterns in the dataset, enabling it to generalize these concepts.

2. **Recognizing Patterns**:
   - Over time, the model becomes more proficient at identifying how numbers relate within Laegna Math.
   - This improves the AI’s ability to assist with advanced mathematical operations tailored to your system.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use tools like PyTorch and Hugging Face to fine-tune models.
   - Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs) for optimal results.

### **Executing the Trained Model**

#### **Using LM Studio and GPT4All**
- **LM Studio**: A platform for locally running large language models trained in GGUF format. Install LM Studio and load the `trained_model.gguf` file to interact with your AI offline.
- **GPT4All**: Another versatile tool for deploying models locally. Similar to LM Studio, you can use it to test mathematical reasoning based on Laegna Math.

#### **Online Deployment**
- **Web Integration**: Use Flask (web framework) and Mistune (Markdown processor) to serve Markdown documentation alongside AI functionalities. This allows users to access your project directly through a browser.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Set up a Flask server.
  2. Host AI endpoints for querying trained models.
  3. Provide user-friendly documentation in Markdown format via Mistune.

### **Empowering Users: Programming Tools Without Programming Expertise**

Modern tools simplify the process of working with AI, making it accessible even to non-programmers. Here’s what users need to know:
1. **APIs**: Learn how to interact with pre-built systems via simple API calls.
2. **Programming Tools**: Use VSCode and GitHub to organize code and collaborate with others.
3. **Version Control**: Track changes using Git to manage projects efficiently.
4. **Markdown**: Leverage Markdown for documentation, making the project understandable to both developers and users.

### **Project Goal: "Teaching New Math to Old AIs"**

Together, we've built a system that transforms existing AI models into learners of new mathematical concepts. By integrating question-and-answer datasets, conversion tools, and fine-tuning techniques, we've crafted a process where AI adapts to novel ideas like Laegna Math. This is just the beginning—users and contributors can extend functionality and refine implementations, creating a living project that evolves with its community.
