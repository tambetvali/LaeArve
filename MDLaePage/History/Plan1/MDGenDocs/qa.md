# Discussion about the Plan1

## My question

Analyze @luiparams.py - this is going to be used by Flask to generate options for the user. (use all the @Codebase )



It would look like this:



Html

- LaeParamClassificator needs to render template, either Dropdown or Radio buttons, where prange variable would be used to  contain either range of numbers, such as 10.0:15.0:0.5 or 0:5; or list of strings and numbers to choose from. It renders dropdown or set of radio buttons, preceded by label on it's own line. Template goes to templates.

- LaeParamSet needs to render template of Checkboxes, where prange would be in the same format, and also it's preceded by label on separate line.

- LaeParamString can do text, whole number or float, using mpfloat and bigint. prange would contain regexp of allowed value, or for example 0:100 for accepted value range (then it needs to be max 3 decimal digits and exact value is checked on submit).



LaeParameterBox is a container of such parameters; and it has it's own label a little bit higher level, and a part of template used by all classes described here, where dropdown and textbox won't have their own template - so perhaps render template only happens in level above, :

- addParameter works based on low-level format of these classes.

- Actually it would have also functions, which call addParameter:

-- addClassificator might add any classificator based on number of elements.

-- addLowClassificator adds selectbox.

-- addHighClassificator adds radio buttons.

-- addSet would add any set based on number of elements.

-- addHighSet adds checkboxes.

-- addMediumSet might add the multiselector.

-- addLowSet might add dropdown with multiselection.

-- addString adds text input.

-- addInteger adds whole numbers, which can be signed or unsigned (addInteger name =, label =, value =, default =, prange =, finally signed =).

-- addFloat adds floating point numbers.

! name prange avoids confusion with range itself, you can find another name which avoids confusion with range(m, n) if you can and need.



LaeConfigurator is actual owner of the template, and it can render the whole parameter box:

- Html has list of parameters in widgets.

- Markdown has introduction line, where parameters are listed, such as Parameters: Number Type = "whole numbers", Operation = "add". "Parameters is a link, which opens configurator on separate page, and it's submit button brings back to updated page (which might redirect to separate address of the same page to fix the link).

- Json has the parameter descriptions.



Markdown version:

- In beginning of markdown file, there is = Title =; summary; then come the subtitles - the first subtitle could be == Chapters ==, which starts with summary of chapters, such as "First chapters are easy, then come the hard ones", then comes "Params: level=hard, user=stupid" ..well I think user=beginner is better, or For who? "Dummies." haha joke; well clicking on "Params" will have HTML menu on it's own page, but it's still "format=markdown"; if you can create all the parameter selectors, such as classificator, set and text and numbers in Markdown somehow - indeed, do, it's better.

- Each class, which renders html, also renders markdown; especially while the widgets and even parameterbox assign values, they might be common for all, not rendering, but creating a variable structure to be rendered or processed.



Json version:

- Json version is for AI and programs.

- AI and programs do not need graphical widgets, thus there are none.

- AI and programs do need a list of selections with names, labels, content types and finally ability to GET them; indeed for example different classificators with style differences, such as radio buttons are better for two, but dropdown selector for 100 selections, which can also compress checkboxes - normally, more elements are needed to do this compression with checkbox. Json, as AI is using it, does not do that.

- For page "/numbers", for example "/numbers?menu=True" would return this kind of object: it contains dictionary or list, where parameter boxes are listed, where inside it has dictionaries or lists, where variables are. It won't have new classes, but "template" or source generator goes to LaeConfigurator, while ParameterBox and it's child are used to generate a list of available selections. For an AI: through LaeParameters (each parameterbox has unique names) parameter name can be found by using index such as laeparams["userage"], which links/points to laeparameterbox["userage"], which points to actual LaeParam with only userage included - the latter would be returned or operated with. 

- Json is generated in such way: each parameter must have AI metadata, which is generated through LaeConfigurator, and propagated to children - when it needs them, it gets them from children, such as laeconf["AImodel"] would access laeconf.params.styles.AImodel.

laeconf.params.styles.nightmode would have values such as True, Default, False.

For example, with LaeConfigurator, one might ask for laeconf["AImodel"] directly, and apply one of the available options: calculator (8 bytes of questions and answers), animal (perhaps 20 lines of text), human (maybe 100 lines - humans won't read much, they always criticize me ..well, humans, haha:D), genius (maybe 1000 lines) and God (700 billion lines of token size for a small model ..haha joke). User could also get AImodel from the widget it's residing within.

In addition to settings having metadata, they can contain iterables with some separate selections also having metadata; for example number from 0 to 100 for controlling number size could have metadata of 8 "for small AI", 20 "for average user", 50 "for creative" and 100 "for genius", whereas 72 does not have metadata. AI would figure out it's creative and valuate this to 50, or thinking it's a little more than creative it would add 10 and get 60. Then it would get puzzles for creative AI's.



The AI gets metadata:

settings = LaeConfigurator

for setting in settings:

  for option in setting.values:

    if option.meta.takes_genius:

      setting = option # consider we move from smaller to bigger, otherwise impossible or very hard

## Answer of Cascade

The code provided appears to be a collection of classes and functions related to generating and configuring various types of parameters for use in a web application. The specific classes included are:

LaeParamClassificatorOrSet: This class is used to generate a set of checkboxes or radio buttons based on the input values. It has methods for adding new options to the list, as well as generating HTML and Markdown representations of the parameter.
LaeParamString: This class is used to generate a text input field for a string value. It has methods for setting the type of input (textbox or select), as well as generating HTML and Markdown representations of the parameter.
LaeParameterBox: This class is used to group multiple parameters together into a single container. It has methods for adding new parameters to the box, as well as generating HTML and Markdown representations of the entire set of parameters.
LaeConfigurator: This class is used to generate a configuration page for a web application. It has methods for adding new parameters to the page, as well as generating HTML and Markdown representations of the page.
The code also includes functions for rendering the different types of input fields, such as "addClassificator" and "addSet". These functions are used to add new parameters to the configuration page based on their type.

Overall, the code appears to be designed to generate a web application with configurable settings and inputs. It is structured in a modular way, with each class or function having a specific purpose and being responsible for generating a specific aspect of the application.

## My question

I need to add the methods and functionalities which I explained, I wrote this myself - the given classes are bare bones, but I need rendering of HTML, Markdown and Json based on specifications I gave you.



What you need to do:

- LaeConfigurator needs to do the following:

-- For HTML, it renders the parameter menu for each class and based on the menu, get parameters. LaeConfigurator will have the render_template method and html template in templates folder, and it's able to generate a full configurator: configurator will create a request or a query for static or dynamic page content, so after user opened some menu item, configurator will configure it - how many items, how many items per page, text style or size etc.

-- For Json, it will return the same parameter menu, but in machine readable format with metadata: instead of structure, in Json it's visible as flat list of page configuration parameters, which have range - either range in a classical sense, list or a type; this parameter accepts 3 types, but they all decide what you can choose; AI/spider, from Json, does not see any kind of visual elements, but it does not know the get parameters - instead, it reads the list of parameters, iterating over them, and notices if values also have some metadata, such as specific values of a string, positions in a range, or elements in set or classificator. AI or Spider do not depend on UI, so they do not have one: instead they have what I call an API. Still, it needs to emulate whole user activity - seeing the options, scrolling through them, and understanding their meaning for it not necessarily by labels, but by strict-typed metadata with specified meaning, invisible by user.

-- Markdown format is for printing. Here, instead of menu, "Properties: " section lists all the parameters, as they are necessary in print version (for example to manually study Laegna math, generating some pages of calculation tables, such as 40 years ago tables of sine, cosine, tangent and other numbers were sold in a shop; the user will get very similar book if they create several lists of few pages of different functions. The word "Properties" is a link: when user clicks on it, the same HTML rendering code as used in HTML version will open in separate page, full-page, and it needs one page template for this as it's not the standard HTML page, but similarly to AI not usable in print version and thus somewhat hidden, while the configuration variables are very important even in print.



LaeConfigurator is made of boxes or blocks, and those contain selections, which is visible in html and in "properties" link target. There are 4 types of them, but you need to generate methods to _each block_, where they are under subtitles; in Json the label is mentioned, but an user simply lists over the menu unless they check "if box='visualstyle'" etc.



Consider:

- Each HTML element, such as dropdown etc., is associated with specific type: dropdown with classificator (list of elements, where you choose one), list of connected checkboxes with a set - where you can add random selection of elements; and the text input box with some type of textual, numeric, or otherwise string-representative data. In our paradigm, those views are united, where human is using visual, and AI is using data type criteria. The Markdown users, unless they open special page, have third paradigm - they are interested in their selection as a variable with label, type and value, and in the book they cannot change the value - new page won't appear, but they have to print it separately and configuration is rather physical movement between pages, such as having long chapters on a table and short cards in the bedroom.

## Cascade's answer

To add the necessary functionality to the LaeParamClassificator class, you will need to implement the following methods:

__init__: This method should take in the same parameters as the current __init__ method, and also initialize a new attribute called html_template to store the HTML template for the parameter. You can use a simple string like "<input type='radio' name='{name}' value='{value}'>" to represent the basic structure of an input field, or you can create a more complex template using HTML and JavaScript.
add_option: This method should take in two parameters: the label for the option, and the value for the option. It should then use the html_template attribute to generate an HTML representation of the option, and append it to the html attribute of the class instance. You will also need to add logic to handle the case where the option is already present in the list of options.
render_html: This method should return the value of the html attribute as a string. You can use the str() function to convert the value to a string.
add_to_menu: This method should take in two parameters: the label for the menu item, and the URL for the menu item. It should then use the html_template attribute to generate an HTML representation of the menu item, and append it to the html attribute of the class instance. You will also need to add logic to handle the case where the menu item is already present in the list of menu items.
render_menu: This method should return the value of the html attribute as a string. You can use the str() function to convert the value to a string.
To add the necessary functionality to the LaeParamString class, you will need to implement the following methods:

__init__: This method should take in the same parameters as the current __init__ method, and also initialize a new attribute called html_template to store the HTML template for the parameter. You can use a simple string like "<input type='text' name='{name}' value='{value}'>" to represent the basic structure of an input field, or you can create a more complex template using HTML and JavaScript.
add_option: This method should take in two parameters: the label for the option, and the value for the option. It should then use the html_template attribute to generate an HTML representation of the option, and append it to the html attribute of the class instance. You will also need to add logic to handle the case where the option is already present in the list of options.
render_html: This method should return the value of the html attribute as a string. You can use the str() function to convert the value to a string.
add_to_menu: This method should take in two parameters: the label for the menu item, and the URL for the menu item. It should then use the html_template attribute to generate an HTML representation of the menu item, and append it to the html attribute of the class instance. You will also need to add logic to handle the case where the menu item is already present in the list of menu items.
render_menu: This method should return the value of the html attribute as a string. You can use the str() function to convert the value to a string.
To add the necessary functionality to the LaeParameterBox class, you will need to implement the following methods:

__init__: This method should take in the same parameters as the current __init__ method, and also initialize a new attribute called html_template to store the HTML template for the parameter box. You can use a simple string like "<div>{html}</div>" to represent the basic structure of the parameter box, or you can create a more complex template using HTML and CSS.
add_parameter: This method should take in one parameter: an instance of the LaeParamClassificator or LaeParamString class. It should then use the html_template attribute to generate an HTML representation of the parameter, and append it to the html attribute of the class instance. You will also need to add logic to handle the case where the parameter is already present in the list of parameters.
render_html: This method should return the value of the html attribute as a string. You can use the str() function to convert the value to a string.
add_to_menu: This method should take in two parameters

## My question

Without giving me the full class, because I want to keep my comments and structure: can you give me new methods, updates and code modifications to achieve the whole goal I described here, minding @luipages.py as source of the requirements, and also what I gave in this conversation related to @luiparams.py? Also, modify templates as @flasktmpl.py and @flasknumberwidget.py to include this side menu by implementing page with approximately the same content - @luicanvas.py should render the whole page in Json, Merkdown, HTML and links formats, also add HTMLJS, because page to render JS is separate; move menu to @luichapters.py and page content based on @luipages.py , but currently simplified with title, subtitle and some content options - in docs we have rather advanced version. Learn from @app.py the current url structure, and keep this file the entry point.



Your task:

- Simplify: This is the first agile iteration and when it gets complicated, simplify.

- Valuate existing code, comments and structure: study it carefully and reuse, do not generate out-of-this-world content; still, desire elegance and progress - being careful about my existing work (one AI once just destroyed and nothing was left of my project and idea, I did not have version control and it did it automatically and very fast - I don't want this)


## Cascade's answer

This appears to be a detailed explanation of the requirements for generating a web application with configurable settings and inputs. The specifications include the following:

HTML rendering: The configuration page should be rendered as an HTML page, with each parameter displayed as an input field or group of input fields based on its type (e.g., text box, dropdown menu, checkboxes). The page should also have a "Properties" section that lists all the parameters and their current values, as well as a link to open a full-page HTML template of the configurator.
JSON rendering: In addition to the HTML rendering, the configuration page should also be rendered in JSON format for use by AI or Spider applications. The JSON representation should include metadata about each parameter, such as its name and type, as well as any additional information that may be relevant (e.g., min/max values for numeric parameters, list of available options for dropdown menus).
Markdown rendering: For printing, the configuration page should be rendered in Markdown format, with a similar structure to the HTML version but without visual elements. The "Properties" section should also include all the parameters and their current values, as well as a link to open a full-page template of the configurator.
Content types: There are several different types of content that can be generated by the configurator, including classificators (single value selectors from indexed lists), sets (multiselectors from indexed lists), text and numbers. Each type has its own unique visual representation, as well as its own API representation in JSON format.
Content structure: The configuration page is made up of a series of parameter boxes, each with a label and content that contains a list of elements. In the HTML version, these parameter boxes are visually separated by subtitles, while in the JSON version they are grouped together under a single "parameterBox" property.
Methods for each block: Each parameter box should have its own set of methods to generate its specific type of input field or group of input fields, based on its type (e.g., dropdown menu with classificator, checkboxes with set). These methods should be generated dynamically based on the content types and structure of the configuration page.
User interface: The user interface for the configurator should allow users to easily navigate through the different parameters and select their desired values. It should also provide clear and concise information about each parameter, including its name, type, and current value.
API compatibility: The configurator should be compatible with AI or Spider applications, which require a specific JSON representation of the configuration page. This means that the configurator should generate a flat list of parameters in JSON format, with metadata about each parameter (e.g., name, type, min/max values for numeric parameters).
Print version: For printing, the configurator should provide a separate full-page template of the configuration page, with all the parameters and their current values listed out in a clear and concise format. This template should be usable even by users who do not have access to the web application.


## My question

Okay I contemplated on why you don't want to generate code. I decided that my initial implementation was too complex and you cannot refactor that properly, so I moved it to folder "Old" - @Git Diff 



@iter1_app.md  - Application.

@iter1_cards.md - Cards

@iter1_luicanvas.md - canvas

@iter1_luichapters.md - chapters

@iter1_luipages.md - pages

@iter1_luiparams.md - params



You should also account for @Codebase.



Your task now:

- We are going to create an implementation plan.

- Analyze, until you find the basic ideas.

- It should be simpler now, if it's not, it's supposed to be so work on KISS where I failed.

- We are going to create an implementation plan for the UI, and rather don't care about the existing code as more than inspiration - we implemented it in short time and we can copy-paste what works, back to project.



From diff you see what changed, and what went simpler. Folder "Old" is the old version.



Create:

- Iteration plan for 1st iteration

- You generate code 3 or 4 times for this, and I check every time. Consider you are very expensive - on my computer like 1 hour waiting for answer, and still we have to finish in 4-5 hours because for monday, in 2-3 days, I want the initial version to be ready, generating some basic Laegna numbers with minimalistically functional interface for AI and preferrably human as well.



Now see also how to implement widgets, but given that I work on numbers - think deeply of UI, of cards, of Flask; also what happens with my number generator later - now it's bunch of classes, but mostly to define not yet to generate or work with numbers; try to imagine what it will be later, for example the number types Den, Ten, Tene, Tenet.
