# Pages

Pages:
* Pages appear at right menu.
* When a page is opened, it's content appears in a menu.
* Pages are basically same with the menu.
* Page name is the top level part of url, for example page named "Numbers" creates link "http://127.0.0.1:5000/numbers" without capital letters or accents, in plain english base alphabet.
* Inside a page, one can add documents one after another - main documents and their subdocuments are one flat list in a menu.
