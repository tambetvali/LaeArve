# Laegna Fantasy 2

Because we want to convert existing math cards in Fantasy 1, we did not do this already.

Now the conversion of cards is more complex:
- Take a card, where you notice whole math complex operations with solutions.
- Find equivalent operation in Laegna, which has same numeric result for the same variables or even visible counterparts, which might be used somehow; which is partially intelligent task for different number classes.

Then translate the card. For simpler classes, where they are contextually abstract calculations, the conversions would apply within Fantasy 2, so that the computer can mix them with reality by comparisons: it would still know, how the calculator would behave.

Goal: for something like 2 * 3 + 5 * 7, we don't know the order operands, such that both multiplications would have happened before than our actual case, the addition in the center, which I would see as important part; rather you do _each calculation in order_, and you are free to either keep or destroy the indeterminant between multiple sessions of the calculator, to use this effect also in longer term. We have simplified the conversion to decimal system, where we use a few parameters in limited dimensions to achieve consistent approximation of the effect, like it itself would be rounded.

## Math of this Card

### R

Multiplication, substraction, adding, division:

Acceleratory "non-linear" operators:
- multiplication
- substraction

#### RT

They have T value of their own calculation, where they are interested: keep their relative disproportions invariant, for example in 2 * 4 + 5 remember that in operation _2 => 4_, _4_ is __two times bigger__.

#### RR

__Multiplication and division__ use the same variable in opposite direction to contain R value they calculate: for each _addition_ or _subtraction_, they note down, _relatively_, how many times the latter would have been bigger than the preceding one; and in regards to their own calculation, they _reverse_ this effect so their counterparts would be invariant to their relation, where we have the actual math.

### T

Velocited _linear_ operators:
- plus
- minus

#### TT

They have T value of their own calculation, where they are interested: keep their relative disproportions invariant, for example in 2 * 4 + 5 remember that in operation _4 => 5_, _5_ is __bigger by one__.

#### TR

__Addition and subtraction__ use the same variable in opposite direction to contain R value they calculate: for each _multiplication_ or _division_, they note down, _relatively_, how many units the latter would have been bigger than the preceding one; and in regards to their own calculation, they _reverse_ this effect so their counterparts would be invariant to their relation, where we have the actual math.
