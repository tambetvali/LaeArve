# Laegna Alphabet

Letters "U", "I", "O", "A", "E" and "V" are special.

For forming words, I use these letters as a basis, especially the first 5 letters (without "V", which is upside-down U and thus a specially considered special case of another letter; still, it's included in base alphabet because of the special meaning of this letter).

There is a special magic that when looking to normal language, one could analyze words and see that changes in letters often resemble the numeric values of Laegna.

## Shapes of letters

Up and down mean what up and down mean in Laegna, left and right mean what left and right mean in laegna. Up and down parts of the letters are from higher to lower; whereas left and right sides are from past to future. Up and down, like "I" and "E", are long apart and symbolize the bigger change from good to bad, the infinity; right and left are half in size and compare to finite, smaller changes. When the bigger change is more meaningful, the smaller size is more like a coordinate system.

Sharp corners mean infinity, whereas smooth corners mean finity.

I think of the letters as functions - I decoded them hard to make every line and curve of the number mean something, and these forms seem universal.

## Sounds of the letters - history of Laegna

I sat down and thought I want to create my own language.

I tried all the vocals, listening their sounds.
"I" is used in negative meanings, like being uttely in trouble.
"O" is used to make sounds of bravery.
"U" is the most neutral pitch.
"A" is more open, and in Estonian "AA" means "I understand".
"E" is the best, sounds the best.

## Logecs

I changed "I" to "E" from "logic" to "logec", showing that I want to reach the infinity and meaning, and explain life in logical terms. Life, as I see, contains a paradox - there is something good in bad, and something bad in good. So the binary logic, it always lies about the life.
