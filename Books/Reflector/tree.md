This folder:
- Redirects to Root folder of Code File Tree.
- Implements minimized or altered copies of that file tree, especially for smaller or custom bots to study.

  It's still meant to utilize the libraries around.

# Ideal Root Folder

The folder "Reflector" points to inside Root Folder of the Source Code, but is in the folder "Reflector" of the website: by this, the website is self-reflecting, visually aware of it's own Higher Self, an archetypal reality.

The code resides in higher realms, as a metatemplate of the real, material website, a single instance in the realm of infinity of possibilities: as many as there are input variables and side-effects, which provide even the "Dead Code" just an infinite __Butterfly Effect in Program Instances__. Without reflector, the users would see just shadows of this higher reality, the _code itself_, reflections of it's structure in it's materializations and generations. To be properly "open sourced", so that the source is perfectly visible, navigable and decodable, we need a self-reflection element of the website.
