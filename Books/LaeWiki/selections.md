# Selections

To allow the Wiki format, there should be also a selection format:
- This is our custom format of link to refer a selection of text in the original page, from and to certain character
- Selectors should allow extensions:
  - Box selection, selecting a square of text
  - Multiselection, selecting several pieces of text
  - Image selection, selecting some part of an image contained
    - Similarly, sound selection etc.
- There should be abstract selectors
  - Variables, classes etc. from the program contained
  - Metadata items, not linked directly to the text creating them

## Updates

Selections, given the original version of the page and each link, should contain update helpers to update to new version, given the changelog.
