# Theorem of Imperfection

__Theorem of Imperfection__: states that instead of living in ideal world, we live in the world, where logic needs to constantly improve it's truth and objectives (1st subtheorem); thus, Truth cannot be measured as simple "Yes" or "Now", but we involve ponegative of 4 - __Truth__ and it's _Corrective Value_ (2nd subtheorem), which we call reality and imaginarity axe respectively.

__Real and Imaginary axe__: in ponegation, it's often hard to view those separately: rather, the _real_ and _projective_ or _imaginary_ are the row and column of matrix [["I", "O"], ["A", "E"]], where the letters form some combination. We cannot be sure about what is real, or even what was imagined - so where we find the actual value is constant, ongoing process of improving the value, where we can say this maps _real_ and _imaginary_ in the way I did show.

_Kunown Ten(`i`) => Dene(`R`, `T`)_, __Tendene__: we can measure values of each `Polar` `Ten` as `Dene` in the following way:
- __Ten(`E`) => Dene__: Ten(`E`) = Dene(R = `O`, T = `A`)
- __Ten(`A`) => Dene__: Ten(`A`) = Dene(R = `A`, T = `A`)
- __Ten(`O`) => Dene__: Ten(`O`) = Dene(R = `O`, T = `O`)
- __Ten(`I`) => Dene__: Ten(`I`) = Dene(R = `A`, T = `O`).

_Kunown Ten(`i`) => Dene(`R`, `T`)_, __Tundunu__:
- `U`: is unknown of `O` and `A`, with 50%:50% distribution. We see that it's the center of certain composed Axe, a dimension.
- `V`: and `V` are unknown of `E` and `I` with _equal distribution_. We see that they are the center of second composed axe, another dimension.
- `U` and `V` map to the same position, but their dimensionality and thus, frequency, are _different_, and since this dimensional difference expects another bit of value, they are distinct values much like `A` and `E` or `I` and `O`, which are seen equal by binary system mappings.

_Tundunu_, __Tundun__: you can explain those words in estonian, where they mean _to seem_, constructing the artificial etymology of rule-based language, mapping to the inspirational languages of it's system verification.
