# TorchTune

Our default method perhaps in developer environment, where the user environment might prefer _OpenLLM_. We are scalable about choosing the fine-tuners for different tasks and models.

I prefer __PyTorch__ as it's a standard library: TensorFlow used by HuggingFace is constantly breaking in backwards compability with the books and in future, your own code. We want to use rather what is kind of _settled_, not providing with all kinds of surprise.
