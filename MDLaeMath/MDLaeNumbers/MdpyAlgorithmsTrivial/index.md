# Trivial Algorithms

Here we implement some most trivial algorithms to generate some lists of numbers.

Each list is of different type, but each list is Laegna. The method of implementation is trivial and thus, we have a "cheap" options to get many Laegna numbers - putting them into lists and doing operations with list indexes, we can also teach the bot some basic rather Latin operations on Laegna numbers; anyway, in scope of finite numbers, the + - * / map to existing operations of Laegna Math, while their interpretation is different as the number space is different; for large and small numbers, also for special cases like V, they behave differently.
