# Number basis of Laegna System

Basic numbers are defined by this property:
- Number has an "angle", which is equal to an angle appearing on edge of the circle, where the circular form is initially point (360 degrees inwards / 0 degrees closing the whole circular form inside a single point), then perfectly round ("90 degrees" in a sense), and finally linear (180 degrees inwards or 0 degrees curve/turn of the outline being a straight line).
- Angles come then from minus linearity to minus perfect circularity to zero to plus circularity to plus linearity.
- At those angles, properties of -infinity, -finity, 0, +finity and +infinity appear.
- We denote those with Laegna numbers, -infinity=I, -finity=O, 0=U, +finity=A and +infinity=E, and V which closes it outwards, so that the number circle meets to it's beginning or next round and especially to meet the infinity at a point, where there is the limit, not just indefinitely growing number with more possibilities.

__Laegna number value__: Forming 4 ranges, based on angles, from minus infinity to infinity; taking this one octave downwards so that 1 becomes 0, infinity becomes 1 etc., we have an infinite fractal or a number with infinite number of digits allowed, but with known convergence at infinity - the property we seek for.

These IE range numbers also fit to 1-4, first 4 position numbers of decimal systems, but rather we have our own, Laegna (Latin) Decimal System.

In this system: outwards, it curves not around the center, but "around" the outer infinity. Here, we have 4 more angles to close it outwards and reach "absolute zero", which we call "9" in regards to inner "U" being "0" in regards to this scope.

We also use complex system of 16 letters to have those angles measured at the same time, as the information is forming strictly two systems of information - given our balance of combinatorics, we use the same amount, but separate information to measure numbers outside, as we do in inwards direction. This, from 5 to 8, we call range 48.

__Relation to Infinity__: if God is the total reality, then if human chakras map from frequency I to frequency E (from 1 to 4), God would map from 5 to 8 to be like described in Kybalion - something, which has us so invisible that we are like matter, and seem linear in regards to accelerative system of sych consciousness. Mathematically, the frequency exists, despite being very complex, topologically not mappable, and forming another dimension: the case of a higher dimension mathematically appearing would mean that God, at his original dimension, would see us as being in the lower dimension, rather atom vibrations than anything else; our united frequencies would draw topological shapes still there, where that frequency would project one person downwards rather consistently. We don't concentrate on this, but 14 and 48 differ in a way, which differentiates God from Humans in religion: being the *outside limit of the system* and the *inside limit of the system*, mapped into logical space.
