# Interactive content

This is a Document builder, where you can build structured documents and export to different formats.

For example, you can export to Web Page.

I think when we are creating content for an AI, such environment for creating Documentation is good: you can create structured version of your text, which looks like chm help file (if you know those): with tree links on the left, each opening a content page. For example, you might have a tree of topics and you can create each one.

While this looks like this system itself - you can also create tree-structured Md files - it's still a visual editor and you could use it when you add specific content.
