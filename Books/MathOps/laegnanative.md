# This is Laegna native system of operators

As only some of indifferentiable digits exist in character map for math, I use them for emulation of at least some examples in Laegna. This is Laegna operation set, not related to Latin, but still having the four basic operations as well; the lines of operators could be actually a little less in length.

܋ - facing downwards, line with one dot is division
߸ - facing upwards, it's a multiplication
÷ - facing up and downwards, it's V; the U in direction of exponent and imponent
I did not find more letters tough now it's clear..
facing forewards, it's an addition
facing backwards, it's subtraction
facing fore- and backwards, it's U

Two dots in row can be used for each: this is to replace 4 with 8, where U and V also become two-dimensional, convertible to two digits of U and V, these digits form a new frequency or mix the OA and IE scales.

Two components R and T are typical: they are also used as digits to form operators, for example you can decide about each digit position what to do AAE ߸÷߸ would not define an effect of this being O or A; _ can be used to omit an operation, tough to be used with care.

Note: These could be used as operator, as sign of a number, or for example sign of each digit in place of the accent.

AAE ܋߸ IOO would subtract in infinity scale (numbers somehow appearing as multipliers of 2) and add in finity scale (numbers appearing rather contain 1's in their 12-base-2 representation, where 1 and 2 are used in base 2 as simple natural digit value system). For example, where 1 is 1-based, 2 is 2-based, 4 is 2-based, but then 3 must be 1-based to find this balance; you can account this backwards looking. Where each digit is allowed as sign, ߹I would for example be the I-connected number with precision of 1 digit of negative infinity, where higher precision means more mass of this number. Without signs, to note them with first digit, only I and II and III could be used in sub-base 1 system, because no other digits are left, unless knots are formed.
