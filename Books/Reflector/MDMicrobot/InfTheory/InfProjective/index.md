# __First Projective Theorem of Infinity__

_1Ainf_, _First Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Infinity Theorem__: _given an information density of a number_, radius _`r`_ = _infinity of positive numbers_, where the line of a circle is straight (radius = infinity) and _`r`_ = positive zero, where the line of a circle is the opposite of straight; after that the line is non-geometric in given space (with angle _through itself_).

_1Ainf_, _First Projective Theorem of Infinity_ (defining double-infinity): diameter `d` of the circle given in _1Ainf_ is the infinity of unsigned numbers; on our primary, zeroless system it's two infinities, which we sometimes map to single infinity.

_Counting nambers based on first Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Number Theorem__: we divide all the angles into numbers `i`, `o`, `a`, `e` (`ie`), or `1` to `4` (`14`) which on their own contain only the angle. Each number has given angle, with `e` being Infinity, `a` being plus Zero, `o` being minus zero and `i` being minus infinity.

_1Binf_, _Following First Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Infinity Theorem__: if we map Infinity, as given in _1Ainf_, to One, and One to given Infinity (in octave 0, `E`, and octave 1, infinite number of `E`'s); we get the outer space of infinity, where the previous `E` maps to Zero (either `I` or `A` signed/unsigned).

_Counting members based on first Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Number Theorem__: we divide all the angles into numbers `I`, `O`, `A`, `E` (`IE`), or `5` to `8` (`48`) which on their own contain only the angle. Each number has given angle, with `E` being Infinity, `A` being plus Zero, `O` being minus zero and `I` being minus infinity.

_Counting numbers, __Radian Number Theorem__: index numbers are counted based on their index values, and we call _compressed_ counting numbers _index numbers_: for example, Decimal system on it's own is often used to count in indexes, where _uniqueness_ and _order_ matter more than _number properties_.

_Finding natural and continuous numbers, __Radian Number Theorem__: Given the number scale of `AE` pointing from zero to infinity (remember how numbers are read - initial direction towards final direction or acceleration result in infinity to that same number); we multiply the number length with infinity `R` to form discrete number system, or `RÂ²` to form continuous number system.

_Uncountability of Infinities_: since infinities add dimensions, they are uncountable in lower systems; rather, we use _proportions_ and _symmetries_, for example the real angles.
