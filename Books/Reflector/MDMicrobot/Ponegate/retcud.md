# _Unet Ten and Den_ of base-6 (and base-3), __Tundun__:

_Unet Ten and Den_ of base-6 (and base-3): @_Basic Ten and Den of base-UV_

__Signed Ten__: for `I, O, A, E = 1, 2, 3, 4`; while there is no zero between `2` and `3`, there is the center - under this, we are _too slow_ (_velotiating_) and over this, we are _accelerating_.

__Unsigned Ten__: for `I, O, A, E = -2, -1, 1, 2`; there is no zero between `-1` and `1`, there is the center - under this, we are _going backwards_ or _deccelerating_ and over this, we are _going forward_ or _accelerating_.

_0_, __U__: whereas `V` is either `I` or `E`.

_09_, __Polar UV__, __UV__: For polar values, `U` is center and `V` is extreme, for linear values.

_Linear 09_, __Linear UV__: `U` is the previous and `V` is the next cycle. Linearly, you don't go always _in_ and _out_, but you can pass the _circular number_. _Circularity of Numbers_ is a topic deeper than it initially seems.

`U` is either `O`, `A` (__of Ten__) or more generally any value (_of Ten_, __of Den__). When we don't use `V`, we might use `U` for 4, also if we take `U` one octave up.

_9_, __V__: While `V` means rather _known_, the opposite of _unknown_, the upside down `U` is also denoted `V`. `V` is high-frequency Zero.  It's _unknown_ whether `V`, at any given case, is `I` or `E`.

# Averaging

__Average of U__: Average of `U` is Zero. Thus, lower-frequency `U` is Zero and `Psychological significance` is the main cause for calling `U` also Zero and having this value allowed. Calculations are not affected much.

__Average of U__: Average of `V` is Zero at `Octave 1`, vs. `Oct 0` of `U`. It's defined being point between +Inf and -Inf, between `E` and `I`, but we don't have `E` and `I` backwards by `R=T`, the same-linedness theorem.
