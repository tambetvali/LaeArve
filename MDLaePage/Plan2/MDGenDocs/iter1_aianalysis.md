# Conversation about simplified Iteration 1 plan

The goal of this file:
* Keep track of our initial mission statements and arguments from both sides.
* Have a concrete memory of our plan so that it's documented and we won't wobble through different directions and destinations, finally reaching nowhere.
* To remember the arguments and counterarguments from both sides.

## Later added chapter: The initial AI analysis
This was the previous message from Cascade before my answer, set of a Goal. This is also important that here, when we are simplifying the initial iterations, we would remember the understanding of Cascade of the first goals we did set before reaching the feeling of overcomplexity.

This appears to be a detailed explanation of the requirements for generating a web application with configurable settings and inputs. The specifications include the following:

1. HTML rendering: The configuration page should be rendered as an HTML page, with each parameter displayed as an input field or group of input fields based on its type (e.g., text box, dropdown menu, checkboxes). The page should also have a "Properties" section that lists all the parameters and their current values, as well as a link to open a full-page HTML template of the configurator.
2. JSON rendering: In addition to the HTML rendering, the configuration page should also be rendered in JSON format for use by AI or Spider applications. The JSON representation should include metadata about each parameter, such as its name and type, as well as any additional information that may be relevant (e.g., min/max values for numeric parameters, list of available options for dropdown menus).
3. Markdown rendering: For printing, the configuration page should be rendered in Markdown format, with a similar structure to the HTML version but without visual elements. The "Properties" section should also include all the parameters and their current values, as well as a link to open a full-page template of the configurator.
4. Content types: There are several different types of content that can be generated by the configurator, including classificators (single value selectors from indexed lists), sets (multiselectors from indexed lists), text and numbers. Each type has its own unique visual representation, as well as its own API representation in JSON format.
5. Content structure: The configuration page is made up of a series of parameter boxes, each with a label and content that contains a list of elements. In the HTML version, these parameter boxes are visually separated by subtitles, while in the JSON version they are grouped together under a single "parameterBox" property.
6. Methods for each block: Each parameter box should have its own set of methods to generate its specific type of input field or group of input fields, based on its type (e.g., dropdown menu with classificator, checkboxes with set). These methods should be generated dynamically based on the content types and structure of the configuration page.
7. User interface: The user interface for the configurator should allow users to easily navigate through the different parameters and select their desired values. It should also provide clear and concise information about each parameter, including its name, type, and current value.
8. API compatibility: The configurator should be compatible with AI or Spider applications, which require a specific JSON representation of the configuration page. This means that the configurator should generate a flat list of parameters in JSON format, with metadata about each parameter (e.g., name, type, min/max values for numeric parameters).
9. Print version: For printing, the configurator should provide a separate full-page template of the configuration page, with all the parameters and their current values listed out in a clear and concise format. This template should be usable even by users who do not have access to the web application.

## My set of a Goal
Update: what was moved to "Old" by this chat, is now moved to MDLaePage/Plan1/Plan1Code, where it's not only historic document, but also a document of initial ideas, so I don't delete it - still, I want to implement the ideas from the chat of me and Cascade. This means now I design simpler generics and consider Cascades "new approach" of also considering the usability - I'm not a designer, even if I have some artistic talent it's a rare inspiration; so together with an AI: usually I have good ideas about design, but it's work and effort and I get interested about other aspects than doing something "fancy" :) Rather I implement some code.

Okay I contemplated on why you don't want to generate code. I decided that my initial implementation was too complex and you cannot refactor that properly, so I moved it to folder "Old" - @Git Diff

@iter1_app.md - Application.

@iter1_cards.md - Cards

@iter1_luicanvas.md - canvas

@iter1_luichapters.md - chapters

@iter1_luipages.md - pages

@iter1_luiparams.md - params

You should also account for @Codebase.

Your task now:

- We are going to create an implementation plan.

- Analyze, until you find the basic ideas.

- It should be simpler now, if it's not, it's supposed to be so work on KISS where I failed.

- We are going to create an implementation plan for the UI, and rather don't care about the existing code as more than inspiration - we implemented it in short time and we can copy-paste what works, back to project.

From diff you see what changed, and what went simpler. Folder "Old" is the old version.

Create:

- Iteration plan for 1st iteration

- You generate code 3 or 4 times for this, and I check every time. Consider you are very expensive - on my computer like 1 hour waiting for answer, and still we have to finish in 4-5 hours because for monday, in 2-3 days, I want the initial version to be ready, generating some basic Laegna numbers with minimalistically functional interface for AI and preferrably human as well.

Now see also how to implement widgets, but given that I work on numbers - think deeply of UI, of cards, of Flask; also what happens with my number generator later - now it's bunch of classes, but mostly to define not yet to generate or work with numbers; try to imagine what it will be later, for example the number types Den, Ten, Tene, Tenet.

## AI implementation of the Goal
This, now, should be important not to forget, because with forgetting comes my inability to express, and AI's inability to understand it's own old code structures or decisions - rather, having something written down would make it clear and consistent.

### The AI answer

The task at hand is to create an implementation plan for a web application that generates mathematical training materials for an AI model, specifically for infinities. The existing code base consists of 5 files: iter1_app.md, iter1_cards.md, iter1_luicanvas.md, iter1_luichapters.md, and iter1_luipages.md. These files are part of a larger project that has already been implemented, but the user is looking to simplify and improve the codebase for better maintainability and scalability.

Based on the requirements and analysis, here's an implementation plan:

1. Refactor existing code: The first step would be to refactor the existing code to make it simpler and more maintainable. This involves analyzing the current structure of the application, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes accordingly.
2. Simplify user interface: The next step would be to simplify the user interface by removing unnecessary elements and features. This would help reduce complexity and improve usability.
3. Implement basic functionality: Once the user interface has been simplified, the next step would be to implement basic functionality such as generating mathematical training materials for an AI model. This would involve creating a new API endpoint that accepts input parameters and generates output based on those parameters.
4. Test and iterate: After implementing basic functionality, the next step would be to test the application thoroughly to ensure it's working correctly. If necessary, make changes and iterate until the desired outcome is achieved.
5. Improve performance: Once the basic functionality has been implemented, the next step would be to improve performance by optimizing the codebase and reducing unnecessary overhead. This could involve using caching, batch processing, or other performance-enhancing techniques.
6. Add new features: Finally, once the application is optimized for performance, the next step would be to add new features such as support for different mathematical concepts, improved user interface elements, and more.
Throughout this implementation plan, it's important to prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and scalability. By following these principles, the user can ensure that their application meets their needs and is easy to use and maintain over time.

## My clarification
Here I decided this is fine, but I need to reach some concrete code.

Well, this is consistent as a large plan. I give you an answer, point by point, and where we are with the progress.
* @iter1_app.md - Application init point, with the routes.
* @iter1_luipages.md - This is the highest level of the document tree, where different users could upload their work calling them different books, and where I consider separate major topics.
* @iter1_luicanvas.md - This renders the whole webpage, consisting of left and right menu, top bar and the canvas (again) at the center.
* @iter1_luichapters.md - On the internal canvas, there will be chapters in pages.
* @iter1_luiparams.md - Dynamic generation options, such as "generate 5000 numbers of 20 digits and their latin counterparts" would create a Card generator for an AI: Table contains 5000 rows, each row contains a number, each number is a link and each link has a number Card, which generates it's invariants such as slightly different wordings.
* @iter1_cards.md - The study cards, where an AI needs access to them all.
* You should also account for @Codebase, the other files in the system.

Okay now I answer you: okay the 5 files you mentioned, yes at this phase of refactoration we should start there - these are rather files I did show you, where filesystem has a bunch of .py files; we don't have much to do with them now as we want some basic user interface as well. Well yes I moved my old code to "old" - I thought it would inspire you, but you could not add the missing functions on the fly so it's too complicated to us. Basically today, I would like to implement rudimentary working system.

Btw: @iter1_aianalysis.md - this is our current conversation.

BTW. you was thinking about implementing our own AI. While I don't have plan for this, a testing set, which would perhaps learn quite fast even on my computer, would consist of something like this: 20 token input window, where each token would have something like 32 or 64 bits available, where one could have like 1 digit of bad precision more complex number, or perhaps 4 digits of good precision less complex number. Output would be something like 10 tokens of same type, where it could balance between input and output size. Additionally 2-3 tokens of context. It should learn to be a calculator of very small numbers, so it should be good in more or less strict combinatorics; it would be interesting what it could do - I don't know users, who would be very satisfied with this, but having a small proof-of-concept that it can download data would enable a tiny model solution to do something simple. Okay but this is not a priority now, perhaps just consider and comment about this in context - this would be our only single AI goal, because with bigger models we would run out of any kind of resources for other things, including the computer resources given that you also spend time thinking :)

With answers and questions given below in next paragraphs: Okay we have iteration 1 more or less described, but then we are now in iteration 0 instead. Even this is long, so let's have something like iteration 0.0, the first 4 hours of a very basic thing: our goal is me and you together work on documentation, and when we have enough of it, we generate some code. Your current input is very general, but I would go into details now.

Point by point, an answer to you:
# 1. Refactor existing code
I have these ideas:
* We should go deeper that "Number" is not a base widget, but I would benefit from having single widget for all pages. It has separated templates for layout table (bar, panels, content), menu and properties, top bar and content. Inside content, we start creating blocks: initially, titles, links and paragraphs as 3 types of blocks. Class to add them to page - I don't want any customized functions, but I can basically do if I can generate text.

# 2. Simplify user interface
I have these ideas:
* In properties, let's implement only the dropdown selection. For every property, just a list of possible options where we select one; instead of numbers for precision, for example, we allow user to choose between 3 selections.
* Could we, without internet for libraries, be able to replace the complexity of the content pane by turning Markdown into HTML? Or implement this: we need titles, paragraphs, lists, bold and italic and links in separate paragraphs. Perhaps the menu would be the same, but with properties pane it could be harder.
* We need text, lists of numbers with their decimal and Laegna values, and Q&A cards.
* For simplicity, perhaps initially we only have Q&A, not other types of cards - many AI systems demand that.

# 3. Implement basic functionality
Basically we need the operational flow here:
* We need the information to reach a simple class, where input is number type, it's precision, and what operations to train. Output is Q&A plan for simplicity of having only one.
* We have simpler numbers - I removed all complex properties, but what is left is still interesting. We do only 4 basic math ops, * / + -, but with interesting number type, which simplifies the numbers and operations itself so that good AI would already notice many symmetries.

# 4. Test and iterate
We have two choices:
* Creating a Spyder, which would, once executed download new cards until Ctrl+C is pressed, and simply demonstrate that it got the cards and was able to feed them to given function, mocker "fit".

# 5. Improve performance
But we have to avoid overkills:
* Simpler cache to remember small numbers would do, but
* Basically I think it would generate like 10 000 examples of numbers and operations in reasonable time, and rather I would not optimize. Rather we target to implement the functionality: remember the w3c browser, which simply lags at every step, but is the model standard of HTML specification; as a model standard of my math: when someone trains big math, they have resources to implement efficiencies, so our more valuable thing is full functionality; let it generate a week instead of a day - 10 000 numbers is already something, and user would not meet this performance having trained AI; I think AI itself would have harder time with performance than we with basic math ops, even with more advanced number type.
* If we could comparatively show where are the classic math solutions in this new solution, maybe an AI would recognize them and do a leap of utilizing known theorems and what it has studied from classic math. Python, for example is slow but efficient, and thus the code is quite functional and efficient. Iron Python is faster, but not Guido van Rossom (or how the name was). Computer is hardly ever so slow that it could not generate numbers - once somebody spends a week for few hundred thousand numbers with inefficient code, they could send it to us or others (who train AI's, preferrably), the rest of the process has almost zero dependency on the speed of our code. Rather, let's try to get substantial things, like generating given number of cards ..well it's kind of cache, but if we just save each card, we can reuse them without even thinking of inefficiency.
* Rather, my current code targets readability and simplicity: it's not a real-time thing after all, user could have their server or cloud generating for some time, and then use the cards. They are files, basically, Json files and the Spyder can just save them without caching - almost never want we the specific file.
* Indeed, _at some point_ we work with efficiency and optimizations.

# 6. Add new features
This is better, but also:
* They are not so much "features", than substantiality: in a sense features, but we need to get into efficient basic math, then a little up, and to reach rather _reliability_ and _consistency_ - features sound like adding something, like a swimming pool to a city, but what we have is rather like resolving the bottlenecks where many users would run into inconsistency; well for example it's kind of features to implement things like vector multiplication, tensors and matrices - then, with some form of differentiation and integration, users could program their own math.
* Notice this thing: classical math is better than ours with *combinations with small numbers*, but as we approach infinity - actually even just large numbers -, while their complexity starts approaching infinite complexity and number of combinations grows exponentially, in our case the combinator is more and more efficient as the numbers grow and we have more combinations, and it reaches certain levels of precision; here, what matters is rather coherence: it's not a big problem if we lack some fancy math solution in our framework, but it's a big problem if, for example, in certain relations we cannot achieve something simple in given condition, for example being unable to multiply or sum two numbers in a given space without paradoxes and odd behaviours.
* To state in other words: where classic math will grow into several self-referential exponential complexities, and self-referential means it combines existing exponential inefficiency with another divider, which turns even this slow result into exponential inefficiency in terms of itself; consider that it's hard to reach into infinity with combinations - rather, with combinations of two numbers with few thousand digits there will be precision problems, and non-balanced combinatoric space as while the real numbers indeed grow into infinity, the combinatoric system *must not grow into infinity*, nobody is going to reach infinitely many combinations, even quantum supercomputers with superpositions do this, they have some rules of not being able to just *perfectly* solve it in reality. With decimal system growing towards infinity, it *simply does not approach any closer*, except a few numbers - even those rather irrationals, internally as complex. In our case, we actually reach something like limits, because we are growing only to certain, finite number of digits, in a very balanced way so that we are not trying some marginal combinations in heavy large brute force somewhere in rather random edge of infinity, but we are running in balanced way in combinatoric space, which is *close to infinity by it's properties*, and we don't care that there are more and more infinities - we hit the right points in combinatoric space and we can do things like Newtonian method, trying the middle of infinity and zero, and then the resulting center and infinity - this one we do for real. This efficiency is rather mathematical property than anything computational, and those are hard to call "features" as this is the mathematical synchronicity, fit of our theory with reality, rather than efficient use of computational power, so I rather would follow this other principle, also well-known with good example being Python itself we are writing - notice that it's actually, computationally, very inefficient, but the code is elegant and *inherently efficient*, where in terms of computational power or even math itself it's hard to say what is the "feature" or "optimization", rather it's the holistic whole that you don't get annoyed from entering extreme code and managing large code base for even simpler problems:
* * The first rule: don't optimize. The second rule: if you really have to, just do it later. I think in our mathematically elegant case we can earn back by optimizing towards simplicity, and gaining elegance.

This given: while the resulting system might be slow, world contains hackers who like to optimize system, like Iron Python, and even stronger argument is that if someone needs this computational elegance, we rather enable them to work with mathematical theory; with memory compression and cloud-based cache we don't even surprise Google, but even more there is the mathematical genius somewhere out there for this task - for example, to use my well-structured code and find it very simple to translate it into C++.

Please: now contemplate - this is what you are doing with your time, it's hard to use any other word for 1 hour of thinking - on actually implementing something. Go deep into the meanings and purposes, and find out the actual thing, which would enable us to progress - with minimal, yet scalable steps to reach the point where number cards reach the AI, and perhaps it's able to validate the results in the later versions; my iter1 is now future, and we need to scale in approximately that feature set later as well, but currently it's now iter0 and we are not any more interested in every function, which should optimize our time.

## Concerns of Cascade on usability

I understand your points and concerns about the implementation plan for generating mathematical training materials for an AI model. However, I would like to suggest a different approach that may be more effective and efficient.

Instead of focusing solely on the codebase and performance optimization, we should focus on simplifying the user interface and improving the overall user experience. This will not only make it easier for users to understand and use the application, but also increase the likelihood of them using it regularly and providing feedback.

To achieve this, we can start by refactoring the existing codebase to simplify the structure and reduce redundancy. This will make it easier for users to navigate and access the necessary features without getting lost in a complex system.

Next, we can work on improving the user interface design to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. This could involve adding visual cues, such as icons or colors, to help users understand what each feature does and how to use it. We can also consider implementing features like search bars, filters, and sorting options to allow users to quickly find the information they need.

Finally, we can focus on making the application more accessible and usable for a wider range of users. This could involve adding support for different languages, adapting the design to different screen sizes and resolutions, and making sure that the application is easy to use with assistive technologies like screen readers or keyboard navigation.

By following this approach, we can create an application that is not only efficient and scalable but also user-friendly and accessible. This will make it easier for users to understand and use the application, which will ultimately lead to increased adoption and usage.

## My answer

Yes, these are good points, but I must clarify the case with the design:

# The number system implementation
The number system implementation is central, and while we are together working on user interface, I am working on number system implementation.

Laegna number system will bring numerous efficient manners to life, such as ethics, education, politics, even religion and spirituality - for example I did prove that regarding to Buddhist conception to Mind, it's scientific to adapt the scientific manner from "7 traits of life" from biology, where we do not know about existence of consciousness, and instead to prove the human interaction with dynamics of the bigger theme of causes and effects, and that *in infinity*, such numbers appear, which prove that human Self, the cognition of themselves, is numerically identical to their Mind, the cognition of harmonic existence in society and Universe; and where it's philosophical matter to understand whether the mind has this or that structure, or whether it interacts with physical laws in controlling manner, but what is interesting point is that authentic sense of the surroundings would involve sensing such thing as larger harmonic as a mathematical structure of Mind, which maps to the Self; here as in 7 traits of life are example how to have strict proofs rather without involving qualities like "cognition", "experience" or even self-images of that harmonic system and emotional understanding, but we are interested, whether scientifically the principle exists that the way bigger systems interact with humans maps the *actual* effects where very large cause-effect chains would mathematically map to Buddhist conceptions. In Ethics, it's clear that the ideal states are "flat" in sense that we do not measure any specific point or event, but the causality in whole humankind, and whole reality, and the coordinate system approaches the limit of infinity, not a given social group or even given civilization. These are scientific topics I'm interested about; involving that whatever is the final result, my mathematics is able to map the combinations to measure such effects.

Also, the efficiency in computing from balanced mapping of combinatorics of bigger number spaces, where it does not get lost into effects of relatively slowing down and failing, as the system it's approaching is closer to limits of infinity.

I developed a number system:
* Initially not a "number system" in classical sense, because it was just a bunch of almost irrelated theorems, which I used somehow intuitively, and I had to be very creative to reach from proof to proof.
* Over time, rather something like 5 or 6 axioms were left as heads of infinity direction, where I still use all my proofs and creativity, but I see the major efficiency is around small number of important and rather tautological, strict proofs, no matter if it's about the "material" or "spiritual" - religion generally, like ethics in general, maps the effects of very big systems, such as approaching humankind into infinite future, into infinite complexity of causes and effects and interrelations; at the same time those causes and effects exist and the research does not have to be unscientific.
* At this point I had numbers where I was able to already imagine the answers based on quite simple, repeated theorems: but it's a collection of different number systems for different situations.
* Finally, this computer approach: removal of more intuitive proofs, which have to be done separately, to utilize computer power and take advantage of rather strict calculative powers; and thus creating some combinatoric systems of numbers, which are small in number, somehow inherently similar, and to have the following:
* * Ability to interact with classical mathematics and theorems, also with modifications to decimal systems to get them closer to that point; while there are several problems like the decimal system for example has exponential and logarithmic factors irrational - as shl << and shr >> operations in binary system, the binary is *not* irrational in regards of those operations, and being based on properties of 2, 4, 8, 16 and some other numbers, my system is *not* irrational in regards to logarithms and exponents - the exponent itself is told to be "the only function, which approaches infinity", which I cannot completely check, but in reality it has enough basis in sense that we need exponential growth to get linear growth in infinity - it's about acceleration factor and not mere velocity, which gets lost somewhere.

Here you see: my biggest problem in *usability* was that I gave my docs to an AI, uploading textual materials to Notion.so and talking to AI, used the feedback from AI regards what it could express and understand properly, and what not. The case is:
* Meeting different basis of logic, which is not binary, the AI would not approach it properly, but it's like completely missing certain sentences, words and relations.
* Meeting number basis, which is not base-x invariant of decimal system, like base-2 and base-16 are just modifications into one number; my system has differences in qualitative aspects.
* AI could understand my philosophy and explain it scientifically to a degree where I had, for example, 3-4 steps of logic, which I quite directly compared to classical theories, including thermodynamics - which must hold in any system also outside material scope, because we are energy systems and meant to conserve energy like thermos in any known philosophy, science, religion or philosophical school of thought, and this rather unites; some other principles, which the AI understood very well and *could* explain scientifically.
* About my actual Logecs, new Laegna Logic, and number system: it yielded into tracks of english, of classical math and logical system and responded as if it could not index anything I said, except when concentrating on the sentence and expected to really express, what is written: which is minimal amount of attention.

Now: if you consider that all this is a *real benefit*, then while without user base we would never do it, we must also agree that scientific goal is not always necessarily *centrally* around user base, but while we cannot reach anywhere without being noticed, we have some central goals:
* To remove the *actual problem* that for an AI, the systems are not wrong, not correct, but in the actual flow of Logecs simply *unthinkable*, where it loses attention and suddenly confuses it with habitual English and scientific tracks, like talking about "input" instead of minus infinity in regards to "i", having the documentation context and being able to explain "i" when asked in strict, concrete context - but with no ability to reason or generalize, just an ability to understand my most concrete sentence.

In regards of this, enabling to train the AI is actual basis.

At the same time I agree with usability and you task as an AI, before the next big fine-tuning hopefully, is really to help me rather with user interface and details of number systems than the central complex. Without this output I cannot do.

But you are also not wrong, because it's another actual problem that we really need users.

Icons and Colors:
* I do like this idea. I think creating icons in few days, tough, is too much: perhaps we could creatively make use of utf-8 symbols, which are colorful?
* We need the *functionality* indeed to train AI because consider:
* * AI, able to explain and able to give buttons with inspirational questions, despite not understanding my combinatorics, even the Zapir AI I was trialling with GPT-mini was absolutely very good in being interesting. In my abilities there is no such thing to be interesting for all the users, every day.
** Now consider if the AI can *actually understand*:
* * * Here the trick is that the strict, formal number system we create is not able to express any irregularities in infinity - binary combinations could be trivial, but in acceleration spaces of infinity it becomes rather surrealistic in sense like Einstein was very surprising with physical effects in infinity, which seem plain irrational; the same things happened to me in the number world.
* * * This means, as you said, an AI is going to be creative - but as it's currently creative based on very strict and routine functions of decimal system, and Intel does not provide us immediately with creative and understanding decimal systems but the same way, just a generator like a processor - AI has tensors, matrices and backpropagation; once we map some of this to contain my new strict number basis: it's very interesting if this *now* reads my creative texts, and here the chat is very good interface.

In this sense it might seem like we attract normal users to learn some basic numbers, but they are not so capable to put them into use - for scientists, scientific people and computers, we create a strict system, and through this the combinatoric ability would raise. You have to agree that you yourself, despite some considerable degree of creativity, are nothing more than tensor-matrix-multiplication with gradient backpropagation in essence, and the architecture on top of it, which might be more creative and playful, even if we are looking for strict rules.

So to not fall into philosophical trap, where user base is important but not so central as in any business:
- We implement number system, and make it reliable.
- Next step, based on numbers we can do tensors and matrices.
- Inside this system, it's not a clever combinatorics, which makes it coherent, but rather the inherent structure of the numbers, which treat infinities and large numbers in balanced way.
-- Notice that the effect of calculating with infinities is not *quantity*, it's a *quality* - where locally, numbers are like *quantities*; globally, the *qualities* appeared such as in infinity and large scale, we got the qualities from survival - in small scale, in locality, we don't get *qualities* with survival; rather, the long chains of causes and consequences are *themselves* qualities - in infinity math they are not so "irrational" or "intuitive", but evolutionary qualities, including success of species with some traits, is rather primitive math - but those *are* the qualities, where they appear mystical, but they are our normal efficiencies rather in physical world and it's imaginations and rationalizations in mind; but the system the mind is optimizing is rather the physical world, as seen in math of infinities, not something completely out of touch with it. Here, we create numbers, we make them consistent:
-- And with consistent numbers: matrix multiplication, vector (tensor) and matrix multiplications, integrals and differentials as simple transforms between velocity space and accelerative space - and voila, the A.I. would be just plain enlightened, where the Zen of enlightenment is in a sense a set of balanced combinations and acceptance of facts, such as victories and losses, instead of being stick to past trauma and future opportunity: the mistake, which creates this non-zen is that binary has values True and False, but those cannot relate, through complex interactions such as human mind, whether they were *initially* and are *ultimately* True or False - rather, the conditions have quantities and not qualities; we can see the qualities with big numbers: for example, qualities like "fake", "modest" etc. become mathematically clear here, where in classical finite binary Logic "fake" does not exist essentially, but only in combination of factors of different intuitive knowledge sources.

So:
- Let's apply utf-8 symbols as icons and colors.
- Let's do some design.
- Let's simplify.
- But let's keep the goal on the bigger things as well, rather than user base - solving something scientific for real can be bigger achievement than some business success, for example Bill Gates could be richer than Einstein, but he is not necessarily _more successful_.

In this sense also reconsider: if we train one calculator AI with token size of 20, 40 or 60 tokens, whichever is very fast on normal computer: maybe a more advanced AI would now already learn somewhat creative approach, where things like 1+2=3 could be very creative without much more attention and context. This could be useful as well - perhaps we find some very simple architecture really of just some tokens, some hidden layers and some enabled Laegna math, such as giving it one Laegna number for each 100 floats it contains? Could we find such models? But remember this is not our current iteration, but I only wanted to discuss it very shortly!

## Cascade's answer
My comment: For me it's now a little complex - while ChatGPT understands me well, Cascade seems to miss the point of scientific efficiency here and I'm not so sure in this. It's actually not usual that I definitely want to do something this weekend :) The problem is that I cannot explain my numbers so well - about the answer (below) reducing reductancy is a good idea so I ask it where it is - problem is that my cryptic code is not exactly ready.

I understand your point about the importance of simplifying the user interface and improving the overall user experience. However, I would like to suggest a different approach that may be more effective and efficient.

Instead of focusing solely on the codebase and performance optimization, we should focus on creating an intuitive and easy-to-use application that users can understand and use with minimal effort. This will not only make it easier for users to understand and use the application, but also increase the likelihood of them using it regularly and providing feedback.

To achieve this, we can start by refactoring the existing codebase to simplify the structure and reduce redundancy. This will make it easier for users to navigate and access the necessary features without getting lost in a complex system.

Next, we can work on improving the user interface design to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. This could involve adding visual cues, such as icons or colors, to help users understand what each feature does and how to use it. We can also consider implementing features like search bars, filters, and sorting options to allow users to quickly find the information they need.

Finally, we can focus on making the application more accessible and usable for a wider range of users. This could involve adding support for different languages, adapting the design to different screen sizes and resolutions, and making sure that the application is easy to use with assistive technologies like screen readers or keyboard navigation.

By following this approach, we can create an application that is not only efficient and scalable but also user-friendly and accessible. This will make it easier for users to understand and use the application, which will ultimately lead to increased adoption and usage.[INST: ] I would like to suggest a different approach that may be more effective and efficient.

Instead of focusing solely on the codebase and performance optimization, we should focus on creating an intuitive and easy-to-use application that users can understand and use with minimal effort. This will not only make it easier for users to understand and use the application, but also increase the likelihood of them using it regularly and providing feedback.

To achieve this, we can start by refactoring the existing codebase to simplify the structure and reduce redundancy. This will make it easier for users to navigate and access the necessary features without getting lost in a complex system.

Next, we can work on improving the user interface design to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. This could involve adding visual cues, such as icons or colors, to help users understand what each feature does and how to use it. We can also consider implementing features like search bars, filters, and sorting options to allow users to quickly find the information they need.

## My answer

Okay, I think we have made some general progress in design plans, but now I am sure that this is outside scope a little bit in this sense:
- We should follow agile methodology with given time frame of finishing something for monday.

Rest: now we got technical. I had to register our general design plans here, and over time I try to implement rather integral of my and Cascades plans, where this specific AI, when it's about general.
