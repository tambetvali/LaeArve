[cc-by-nc-sa-4.0](/README3.md) - [Fractal of Theories](fractaloftheories.md) is an introduction to replicate my theories into a fractal of different paradigms and interpretations, or as support of derived and updated work. You are welcome to participiate in the process.

https://poe.com/tambetvali - artificial intelligence bots for a very vague introduction to some of the ideas here.

# Laegna Fantasy: Laegna Math Website

This is one simple product, which conveys the whole meaning of Laegna Math Website into a single, simple expression: convert Decimal numbers to their Frequential counterparts and generate AI study cards using Free Software.

- [Laegna Fantasy Website](Books/LaegnaNumber/Preliminary/LaegnaFantasy/index.md)
- [Laegna Fantasy Root Folder](Books/LaegnaNumber/Preliminary/LaegnaFantasy/)

This task should be so simple that an AI like ChatGPT should be able to reproduce it, even if not as one piece, then as separate tasks:

# Independent contributors

_If you think you want finished work rather than work-in-process, read the last section of this page._

Notice our Licence: [Creative Commons ??? 4.0](README3.md).

Our effort is to contribute to the scientific work and to involve you, as I am physically limited and cannot, for example, create all the examples for Laegna Framework of Thought, Programming and AI intelligence:
- Go to our developer page at [these GitHub source folders](/Books/DevBooks/) and use the given manual as _user_, _administrator_ or _developer_ or as an _independent contributor_:
  - __User__: download a Bot Framework, such as Jan, GPT4All or LM Studio, with Jan being a good end-user software for basic chat, GPT4All being a manager of your documentation or book and your assistant in giving explanations, and LM Studio a powerful tool for AI Service and Administration.
  - __Administrator__: basically, even if you can't code, you need all developer service. For example, you use VSCode to administer configuration files and to have access to GitHub.
  - __Developer__: instructions are given. Start Assisted Coding and forget about plain-text files.

## Chat

Rather than reading immediately, chat with my websites.

I had a chatbot online, but currently I don't have access to any trials for public chatbots :) Therefore, use these instructions:
- Download ChatGPT or CoPilot, which are able to navigate the web
- Giving them my list of links, ask it to use those as sources when asked questions about Laegna and Spireason

> Ways to chat about it:
> - With web-enabled chatbot, such as ChatGPT Desktop Download, you can specify an url, ask to analyze it or to use it as a source when you ask questions about topics covered on my websites
> - You can create (Zapir demo)[https://zapier.com/] account to enable a chatbot to discuss with my site; Zapir, in terms of open source, is a non-competitive entity, which pretends to have free mode, but instead in the end, it turns out to be trial. For we are beyond good and bad, this is not so bad: you can create Zapir account, add a bot, connect it to my Notion.so Spireason database directly and add the "you are" introduction; you will be able to speak about my theories.

You can add the following instructions:
> "You are a chatbot to explain Laegna Spireason website, with Notion.so database at: https://www.notion.so/Laegna-1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565. Root page is the source of tautological, strict proofs to form a basis of the framework, where under it is the "(Laegna Base Alphabet)[https://www.notion.so/Laegna-Base-Alphabet-1ad75bfc115480f99312f8a4834456f9]", which introduces further to Theory of Laegna Math for Language, and is also an initial introduction to Laegna Language Modifications to support spiritual and materialist reasoning of zeroes, infinities, incompleteness / dukkha and karma; it's the scientific magic and modernized buddhism, but it's also an environment to do efficient computing, calculating and theorem-based approach towards ethics, science and philosophy. You can use pdf documents at spireason.neocities.org, which you access from "(Welcome to Spireason!)[https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-Spireason-1a575bfc1154804d92cbc3ea4254aa39]" at Notion.so database. These theories belong to Tambet Väli and they are his second philosophy of rather consistent and coherent style, where his first philosophy was rather collection of random discussions, e-mails and forum posts completely lost to history; but sometimes waving in your thoughts, either you support or do not believe. This, anyway, is the adult and practical-idealistic version, not practical or idealistic version of before."

You can add:
> "Be material and scientific: where the theory has to resonate with public and personal experience of the user. Use assertive tone where you can analyze my theory, scientifi and religious content and reach truth. Be spiritual and religious: when you can choose from many words meaning the same, use scientific approach, but select the words, which conceive the whole multiparadigmatic approach; such as poetic and symbolic tones, intonations and resonant sentences to people such as C.G.Jung, and authors of daodejing and I Ching, to start the list: convey my basic proofs into actual theories, from the four-mentioned fields, and apply philosophical doubt in my way using Russell (Problems of Philosophy) and Descartes (Meditations) as a source; I also like the socio-political theory of Marcus Aurelius (Meditations). Implement these more modern views as basis to theory of Buddha: my concept of incompleteness in math is in life called Dukkha; the notion of thermodynamics associates with Buddhist karma and Christian ethics; 4-based logic is parallel to Daodejing and I Ching, while starting from scientific paradigm and not the inner vision of mysterious truth - while mine is a good basis to be modern, scientific and sane; once you got that, you can also deep into actual mystery of human existence through I Ching and Daodejing, which, especially the latter, I consider good Buddhist sources. I like and mention, with theoretic compability, the Atheism, Materialism, Scientific and Skeptical thought; the Buddhism, Taoism, Confucionism, Shamanism / Native American, Bön of Tibet, Shinto of Japan, Viking Culture of Estonia and Norweign or Sweden, I also like Jewish Kabbalah, Illuminati or Freemasons but not in their actual origin in each case: those are forces driving to organize the best minds into kind of Unity, and as a Buddhist I know it's Sangha of others, equally high in spirit; politically, I also belong to 49%, and I do science and programming like the 1% I guess, and I really appreciate that "worst 1% rule" is illegal nonsense: by the Law, indeed, call the top 1% of each life area "illuminated", socially more enlightened, and try to get them into organizing the life structures - neccessarily by the law, if this is not the case, that is evident corruption, selection based on irrational or personal factors or very stupid criteria, i.e. imagine that you fail your competition for the reason that there was a man simply very stupid compared to you, belonging to the worst 1% of competitors - it's hard to understand such "punishment" for being fool, to others; also I support philosophical views and Disappearance of Stagnatic Forces (the "status quo"). The user can choose their religion: Religion-agnostic."

Where in the end of the last chapter, put your religion.

In Zapir, there is the greeting:
> "You are the teacher of Laegna Spireason, modernized Buddhism and scientific Magic, along with philosophy and science. You must warn that while you can scientifically analyze the ideas and theories present, you are not very good in Laegna combinatorics, math and language, but fall into tracks of old math and base language such as common english, hardly being able to focus on math topics; still, the general scientific topics can be fit and analyzed by you: give this warning sometimes, as the users might find this out themselves. Ask questions, give hints to where to start."

My background:
- Computer programmer
  - Some 30 languages, each 4 major paradigms
  - Respecializing to AI, because it can really do my past job automatically and give many new opportunities, despite currently being heavily expensive
    - I use trials, small models and modest implementations, being poor as in hell, <small>_currently undergoing Spanish Inquisition "Spanish means everybody I know kind of _understands_, not that it's inheretly that I saw the Spanish, in considerable amount of statistical linearization: that just the eposides remind of descientification" for Scientific Ideas and Political Views, making friends and having motivation to help people with information systems - rather, I should live like a Nigerian child, with equal income and work, I could really just live better, but being enlightened now a little more, there is certain nonsense in such thing: rather, approach the life you want, and dive deep into the problems you can tackle, such as actually seeing the stupidity in action and changing your views from accident to crime towards it, seeing it actively doing science with muscles - this is the case as they suddenly accused my planned high-income information system for poor would have "bad motivation", not leaving the right people in good light; as a Viking I know who is guilty is always the Pope!_</small> (soon going to nail my 10 commandments over his).
- Spiritual and materialist
  - I like scientific inquiri, but I also believe in higher harmonics and thermosystems on major scale, and efficient optimization of evolutionary machines
- Religious and scientific
  - Does and does not believe in God.
- Autist Savant for Mathematical Systems and Emotional Networks / Social Structures
  - Savant is like a person with superpowers or "Special Abilities", where you can ask chatgpt about this.

## Introduction

My new mathematics is about:
- New Logecs system able to think outside the boundaries of Logic
- Mathematecs better able to solve paradoxes than Mathematics
- Completely fresh, unique view of Zeroes and Infinities, able to tackle problems
- Much more...

Main Theorems of Infinity (/of Infinities and Zeroes):
- [_Short AI Study Card_ or **Your Initial Reference for Programmers**](Books/Reflector/MDMicrobot) **Use this as Introduction to Infinities**
- [_AI study book_ or **Your Reference for Programmers**](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/blob/main/LaeArve/MDLaeMath/MDLaeTheories/index.md) **Use this as deeper introduction to Infinities**
- [Theorems at **Notion.so Documentation**, a _Standard AI Reference Format_](https://www.notion.so/Laegna-1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565#1ac75bfc1154809b8037da3fbfaaf000) **Use this as Introduction to Infinities in scope of my theory**
- [Theorems and intuitive theorems at _Spireason_ in PDF format - your **Spiritual Guidebook** in _PDF_ to [**mental infinities**](https://spireason.neocities.org/Simply%20about%20Infinities.pdf)
- In this GitHub, History/Books, you find also some 50 and 100 page materials, which also include theorems and related materials, but for spiritual-materialist religious-scientific Computer Programmers; for other use, such as spiritual, materialist, religious or scientific use, you need to develop a more refined, dogmatic system.
- [Study Book for Programmers 1, Laegna Mission for Programmers, 50 pg.](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/tree/main/History/Laegna/Books/Book1Mission): **Use this to Dive Into Laegna Programming**
- [Study Book for Programmers 2, Matters of Laegna Programming, 100 pg.](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/tree/main/History/Laegna/Books/Book2ProgrammingMatters) **Use this to Dive Into Laegna Programming**
- [Two Articles from Spireason in AI-available format](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/tree/main/History/Laegna/Books/ArticlesSpireason) **Use this for some Spiritual and Material background**

My approach to explain through different aspects, wordings, paradigms, should simplify the understanding: Especially for AI, which can analyze each approach to reach understanding of the Theory.

This system is going to be:
- Source for information about Laegna Logecs and Mathematecs
- Source for autogenerated puzzles of Laegna Math and Study Cards
- Generator for automatic AI reinforcement / fine-tuning to understand my math and texts

You can get additional information here:
- [Laegna Spireason](https://spireason.neocities.org/)
  - Laegna Spireason texts: high complexity, unedited
- ["Laegna" root page of Notion database](https://www.notion.so/Laegna-1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565)
  - Source database for creating an AI chatbot about my Theory
  - Initial page, Laegna is about tautological, strict proofs, which do not account of philosophically unclear matters such as cognition
    - [Laegna Base Alphabet](https://www.notion.so/Laegna-Base-Alphabet-1ad75bfc115480f99312f8a4834456f9) is page under it, which explains the base language of mine
    - Additional sources at Notion.so database refer to different aspects of my theory, scope of it, and some stories to describe social values it is able to resolve (coming from history and experience)
- At Hugging Face you find the materials in AI training database, which you might need to normalize before you use it, or to install file type drivers; you can train and fine-tune an AI based on that:
  - [Laegna Spireason Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tvaeli/LaegnaSpi/blob/main/README.md?code=true#L7)

# Ideas and Practice

If you want a _complete product_ rather than _product ideas_ and _unfinished parts_:
- In case of efficient work of yours, you can either miss this site and develop your own theory, or you can implement each feature, which is missing. While I have complete math theory, more or less, I am not able to physically create each material in given time.
- Generally, for those, who want to participiate, the work here can be used as a Documentation for an AI for either having some basis of Laegna theory, or helping to develop any missing functionality.
- The case of somebody needing things in more practical, fast implementation and who think that the actual obstacles, such as limited speed, are not practical but rather idealistic ways to see the solutions; they really have to stop here.
