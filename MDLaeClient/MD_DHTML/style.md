# Base style

Initial style, like collapsing the table borders and having some styling for headers and content; this is very basic, elegant, and with a very short CSS to achieve minimal light. The user should not think it's ugly version, when they delete the additional files from HTML page to contain it alone without style sheets and pictures - utf-8 pictures are utilized so it's kind of "ASCII only" in modern world, without images and in case of ?view=HTML, without effects.

The initial style, where no style sheets are included, resembles the site by concept, but might differ by implementation. Each style contained will be _duplicated_ in style sheet files: we want to extend and modify this style sheet without corresponding updates or missing elements, which structrually belong.
