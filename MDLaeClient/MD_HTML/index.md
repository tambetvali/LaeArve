# HTML

"HTML" means it's "Static", which has the following features:
- It's hard to navigate.
- It looks good in print.
- It's automatically readable and can be included to other websites and converted to non-web formats without ugly effects.
- DHTML page could use this page for printing, automatically, enabling printing features in it.

## Outer headers

Page has the following chapters, with class "Autoheaders", which uses H2 tags except for first block, which is the H1 tag:
- Document Title (H1)
- Properties: Links to formats and links to menus ?view=html&menu=1, ?view=html&menu=2
- Section "References": The "references" Markdown section, with autoadded Markdown, creates a structure of titles and links here; with the open book, first few of it's chapters, tree to current chapter and it's next and previous chapters, including the introductions of upper elements in the tree, are included. Class references.
- Section "Content": Has the Content available as described below
 Right pane "Tools": Includes input box html from the page and from the website itself, utilizing headers and other markdown. Class rightpane.
- Section (class footer) with copyright text, author's name

HTML has rules:
- No layout with HTML, only the content; menu and tools are turned into content for that purpose.
- Rather white or light backgrounds to be used for print and reading; the background styles of DHTML would be applied, but replaced with light colors or colors in small areas with equivalent meaning.
