# Interest pages

Bots, over time, create certain interest ratios for their past items.

We utilize Wikipedia or some minimalistic, free Wiki in that purpose:
- For substantial updates, or substantial amounts of time, examples of dialogs are generated based on the bot, the public chat logs (we allow to upload manually or by your configured Spider, who builds your web rather than just "crawls" - we don't need the latter function but the meaningful one; it's suggested not to create technical features if you don't plan a mere library for other developers or power users with command line and administrative capabilities).
- The examples appear on Wikipage
  - The AI, which is made up from ponegatives, not binarieswe update
