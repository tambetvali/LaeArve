# LaeArve - an Introduction

__LaeArve__: The name "LaeArve" comes from Laegna, Arv and e - where "Arv" in Estonian and Laegna language can mean a number, where Position ("A") in Space ("R") is positively bounded ("V" at the end of the word), with suffix Vr or "separate space", which negatively removes the space from the Position "A", producing a number. "E" means that this number system grows to infinity. "Number" ("Arv") or "Namber" (Arve): "N" means "close", "U" means "unknown" but "A" means rather "known" or "Truth"; "m" is positive separator of "b", the value which does not know it's position - it's either a position, or something which happened to be a _"member of positions"_, but is not a position itself; "er" is the infinity of time and space; in reverse "reb" means a space building up from positions (at the end of the word, "e" is at better position than posetive, and "e" often means it's realization into higher position); re as in "ere" (real life, coming from Estonian "bright" and Laegna which starts high, grows into infinity and beyond, vs. "elu", which also starts high, but then relies on others because they won't know; Laegna English equivalents are "life", a left-frequency from smaller to bigger, to "leaf", where e is bigger than a still in position before a, because l is bigger than f in this sense; "leaf" would associate the frequency f with left l in better way - in growing direction; "fa" is positional frequency or frequential position, "le" is a good word in Laegna: where "Lí" is a first step of the long road, which I took from Chinese - as few as I know it, but it's important; similarly "Lu" means something bad, left-unknown or something related to appearance of something dark-mystical, well hard to express as L, but "Le" means home oven, the place where a family is sitting around fire, and is the continuation of the long road itself; Chinese saying says that for the long way, first step is important - as this sentence conveys the meaning of "Lí" in such case, I use the word for such purpose; but I don't know why frequencies would come before infinity and not vice versa, and why the start has to be so hard - if the start is your inner reality, inner realization or inner self; the practice of your home village).

_REDO: Long definitions and descriptions need a short counterpart_: entries in this form are added to dictionaries - use "_" vs. "*" and "__" vs. "**" to create a dictionary entry, a study card. For simpler AI systems, as well as defition lists with multiple definitions, having a short form is a necessity.

__LaeArve__: The name "LaeArve" comes from Laegna, Arv and e - where "Arv" in Estonian and Laegna language can mean a number, and "e" connects it to infinity or to ponegation.

## __Laegna Math Components__, _Lmc_)_:

__Lae__: This is the shortcut for __Laegna__; we use this as prefix for all files, abbreviated to one capital letter __L__, except the Bot, which is rather the User than Laegna and especially which is not Server.

__Lmarch__: Prefix the file with this if it's the framework of Laegna Math, __Laegna Math Framework__, providing common functionality.

__Lmc__: __Laegna Math Client__ prefix for files and classes.

__Lmf__: This is __Laegna Math Fonts__, or __Laegna Fonts__, styles and anything about visualizing Laegna; where "Font" can be eventually seen as symbol, unless we really want to add packages. The central issue is creating a font.

__Lma__: __Laegna Math__, which is the core package of the actual mathematics underneath, which the site is supposed to teach; it's meant to be used as standalone package as well, so it won't have dependencies to other Laegna Math Pages, except for classes specifically meant to integrate.

__Lms__: This is the __Laegna Math Server__.

__Lbs__: This is the __Laegna Bot Spider__, a spider which belongs to some Laegna-capable bot for taking basic lessons before advancing to rather theoretical materials.
