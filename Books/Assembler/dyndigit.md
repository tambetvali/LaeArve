# Dynamic Digits

Numbers, each, exist in space with other numbers.

Consider, for example, a system which is different base at each digit: binary at digit 1, hex at digit 2, decimal at digit 3.

We could write:
0:a:2
0:b:16
0:c:10

Given the ranges and the digits themselves, a b and c, we can now do digitwise different calculations if we convert this to binary.

Consider this, infinity-related b:

-7:0:b:16:32

There is higher range than the frequential range, it projects some values to higher, some to lower space.

In case the digits in higher or lower space would be of same size, for example for -7:0 the digit is rather from positions -7 to -1, where the latter position has number increased by 1 to contain the difference. So it would be, for example, 0:a:7, or there is another digit before a, which might make them symmetric. In all these cases, this is the higher frequency of that digit. If two digits of same density exist at same position, the dimensionality would grow.

Now, in space and time, our number would create such components to be part of larger number: for example, this year of our life could be some digits of our whole life, when expressed by such numbers. We would want to keep the relations, despite we write rather in absolute differences and angles, than relative angles, where this is far too complicated.

The infinity frequencies of digit are mapped to higher variable spaces: where the numbers are like words in a sentence, separated by spaces; for a component, last number before space would be the higher, and the next number would be lower frequency: the Z and Y map together to start forming an oscillation sensor, and either they reflect the same axes Z and Y, which you could call R in general, or they form separate axes: then, to compare to input in dimension, you need to square at those points; so that your "normal operation" would have square axes here.

How we operate with infinities?

For example, single digit of values IOAE has only one infinity symmetry, and one finity symmetry. But as we grow it into numbers, they each have as big symmetry as they are. When this results in infinite web of actual calculations, where we won't stop, but our race or kind would always solve theirs, we can refer to infinity theorem of Laegna: when you use _discrete numbers_, you have no problem with symmetries in infinity.

For two-dimensional numbers we often use, they also have multiple frequencies, where they can be read from down to up, or from right to left, so that they have the same width and height. Indeed, one of them might also map to IE and other to OA: given that frequential dimension is _accelerative_, would you zoom into it's symmetries, it would easily become that frequenial scale has 2 where inertial scale has 1.
