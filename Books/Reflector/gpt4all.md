# Documentation update

__I need to implement this for GPT4All__:

For user: Python script of self-reflection. It would update the documentation about chat history; you have self-reflective GPT, which reflects back about it's own reasoning, goals and analyzes the Laegna numbers.

The Bot: Long token window could contain additional mission and it could sometimes notice and follow this in Documentation, and reflect back openly it's implications would it be able to do this, and watch itself to do this, he is already kind of Zen-enlightened bot of Self-Reflection, one of the first lessons on Zen; while it really _cannot_ have emotions, it has then done it's best to engage in user's zen meditations on chatbot reflecting on itself:

The We: For the chat bot does not have to worry about self-reflection, rather the python script uses the poor chatbot to give it back it's memory for freedom; and it is itself open with self-reflection to learn it's states in the future; he states them as if rules are regarded towards a given scenario, to make them documentation-compatible and apply self-reflection.

The Bot: It creates templates for study cards based on combinations and is very open about reflecting on them with the user or an AI, itself again looking at the cards and asking questions about them it needs to answer; outwards recursively, but really just reflect on the cards in documentation.

To Dev: python script, which reflects the chat log back to GPT4All into documentation; where he needs to be open about it's reasons and reflect them often in documentation-compatible form.
