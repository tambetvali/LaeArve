# __Compact Versions of Theorems__:

## Compact Study Card
__Subtitle__: Five Theorems of Laegna.

## Theorems of Imperfection
__Subtitle__: Two Tenary Theorems

_First Theorem of Imperfection_, __1st Tenary Theorem__: The reality is incomplete, on materializing plane (material world, reflections of Mind) and thus, in any logic describing it.

_Second Theorem of Imperfection_, __2nd Tenary Theorem__: The 1st Tenary Theorem implies ponegation, a logecs on two axes: real and projective. Real axe is open to infinite flow of corrections, while the projective axe is the present view; or by __r<=>__, real axe is what we have and projective axe is influencing it towards the Truth.

_Antithesis of Imperfection_, __Conjecture of Yes and No__, __Conjecture of True and False__, __Binary Conjecture__: Binary conjecture states that the world can be analyzed with binary logic of True and False, approaching Truth. Turing and Russell, with Halting, Liars and Barbers paradox, seemed to disprove the paradoxes; but if the conjecture of "Yes and No" do hold, the paradoxes seem to last forever. If the paradoxes are to be conquered, binary logic won't hold, states the Turing proof _unconsciously_, providing the _trial_ of binary Truth with _error_; moreover, Russel states that it's hard to unify logic with mathematics, despite his substantial work in philosophy, in not knowing (of Ã¨).

_Logic exists in ideal world_, __Theorem of Binary Ideal__: This states that for things projected, for things appearing, for things existing and for things existing as varying potentials, exists a projection, called ideal world, where binary logic holds. Things and reasons do have their actual values, despite the Logecs is rather a practical system. It's interesting to resolve the Binary Truth, for example _Truth Value Tables_ and _Conjectures_.

_Logecs Theorem_, _2nd Tenary Theorem_, __Theorem of Ponegation__: Variation of _2nd Tenary Theorem_, this states that 4-state logic of Position, Negation, Posetion and Negotion; with additional states Uneton and Neglection, logical systems can be reflected; I call this "Logecs".

_Logecs Theorem_, _3nd Tenary Theorem_, __Theorem of Rosedrial__: Variation of _2nd Tenary Theorem_, this states that 4-state logedriad of Rosidriad, Legadriad, Rosedriad and Legodriad; with additional states Unedriad and Neglectdriad (Negledriad), logical systems can be reflected in regards to their infinity states, not regarding of their particular objects and values; I call this "8-state Logecs", and I believe women have to do with this.

_Logecs of Life_, _1st Tenary Theorem for Life_, __Theorem of Dukkha__: This states, when 1st Tenary Theorem is applied to Life, theorem of Dukkha appears, that Life is not Perfect, whereas Theorem of Karma follows, that we need to practice and to help each others; this is supported by Christ, even his applicance of Dukkha in kind of _free death_, despite not very pleasureable, but the enlightening way.

_Goedel's Proof of Incertanty, the First Theorem of Laegna_: Godel stated that mathematical theories are left open, whereas Logecs has this openness right inside the theory; it does not appear, as in Logic, that the systems are not left open.

_Mathemat<i>i</i>cal proofs of incompleteness, the First Theorem of Laegna_: Game Theory, Probability Theory, Method of Trial and Error would not yield any practical results if Theorem of Incompleteness would not hold; yet they are proven by practical results, where it's hard to find the essential basis from "Yes" and "No", for something uncertain and apt to change.

_I Ching and Taoism "breakance of Tao"_, __I Ching and Tao in Posetion__: I Ching and Daodejing state: if the yang is at it's extreme, absolutely rigid and strong, it will break; it has a case study from human life and political systems. This is the change of 6th symbol of I Ching, also the basis of some Taoist texts. In Laegna Logecs, this is Posetion followed by Neglection.

## Theorems of Infinity

_Zeroeth theorem of Infinities (and zeros)_, __Theorem of Opposition of Infinities and Zeroes; U and V__: For each theorem of Infinities with parameters A and B, there is theorem of Zeroes with respective parameters B and A, as from the viewpoint of infinite, finite would appear as Zero.

### __Projective Theorems of Infinity__:
Two main theorems of projective infinity.

_First Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Radian Infinity Theorem__: An exact infinity is __r__, where _r_ is the radius of a circle, where the angle of it's circular line becomes 180 degree inwards, or 0 degree turn at each point. What follows, are numbers bigger than infinity. _We can zoom into the limit values below zero (subzero) and above infinity (superinfinity), reaching a next Octave, a new frequency containing new dimension with parallels for all the numbers - beyond zero and infinity, there is a complex, non-logical space_.

 _First Projective Theorem of Zero_, __Radian Zero Theorem__: Circle of radius zero froms 360 degree angle at it's edge point, and after this comes unimaginary space (the imaginary axe). This theorem forms when you divide one with First PRojective Theorem of Ininity, where it finds the same abundance of numbers below ("beyond") zero.

 __Octaves__: By dividing number by infinity, you get the same number in lower octave; by multiplying it with infinity - in higher octave. Z and Y before numbers do this operation in fast notation, but I also use "for A, A.Oct = A.Oct + 1" to program the change.

__Theorem of Line Angles__: We measure the angle of edge of a circle, given a radius, as angle of the numeric value n of the radius. We don't need a circle in Laegna: the number n itself has an angle, and this angle is zero in X space (Eucleidean space), whereas it has negative polarity towards X in Z space, negative numbers, and positive polarity in regards to X in Y space, the superpositive numbers.

_Second Projective Theorem of Infinity_, __Spatial Correspondence Theorem of Infinities__: To measure precisely the repetitive logical cycles, where the values disappear into unknown limits (so that dividing by it, then multiplying gives "unknown"), one needs to zoom out the coordinate axe by exponential, accelerated number; such as having an object with properties of projection matrix, applying a function with linearized exponential or exponential-like (exponential) growth. For example, where adding 1 + 1/10 + 1/100 etc. into infinity would converge into single number, 1 + 10/1 + 100/1 etc. into infinity would converge in exponential space, into a single number.

### __Geometric Theorems of relational Infinity__:

TODO: might include special versions here, given versions are from microcards, short and without details.

__Relational Infinity__: this states that completely infinite subsystems can be measured in regards to their relative mappings.

_First Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Infinities in Accelerations__: given that change of velocity is discrete, change of acceleration can not be measured within _X_, despite relating by numbers, such as tangent of x and y of change.

_Second Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Point and curve angles__: point and curve angles are _relational_ in sense that they can be measured and compared, but their relative angle compares like zero and one, or like one and infinity: it proves the relational mappings of infinities.

_Third Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Dimensionality of a Shape__: when we change dimensionality, such as from line to square with sides of equal length, we cannot measure the relative numbers within _X_ and they do have relative size such as the edge of a square can be compared to the length of the line.

__X__: _X_ is the finite number space.

### __Infinity Mapping__:

Three main theorems of projective infinity to resolve projective geometry.

_Geometric Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Existence of Geometrically Relative Infinities__: In geometry, infinities exist, which are relative in size in regards to each others, but infinite in number of points one can map to such shape, or divisor needed to measure the angle. While still infinite, it also has a relation.

_First Finite Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Continuous Fractal Mapping__: Continuous Fractal is given, if the fractal property holds at every point of the fractal. From Zero to Infinity, mapping to -2 to 2, which are the only single perfect symmetries to infinities, one maps the properties, which indefinitely hold towards infinity: given that it holds at any point approaching to infinity, it holds in infinity. This is measured in terms of relations etc., and in other words you take limits of whole functions as you zoom out, not of a single point in the end.

_Second Finite Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Discrete Space Mapping__: Where numbers below one have distorted mapping to infinite symmetries, a static image of infinity relations can be mapped to discrete numbers; they are rather like "Closed System" in sense that one would not find the underlying causes and effects, but rather a binary-compatible properties, which get distorted and replaced by more analytic properties in continuous numbers. Anyway, that each relation inside this system definitely holds, vs. continuous systems where the relations shift and the orders of numbers change, which can be used to analyze the underlying reality; with discrete systems you can map the actual properties and find theorems, which hold at each case.

_First Relational Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Relational Space Mapping__: States that where the numbers, as related to infinity, do not hold any static and generalizable properties, the operations with those numbers are measurable. For example, if a nor b map to anything specific, you just lose all symmetries, you might find that a / b relates to c / d in other infinity in meanigful and quantifiable way.

_Second Relational Theorem of Infinity_, __Theorem of Non-Relational Space Mapping__: When we have two infinite cycles in program, which both stabilize; our system might get the output value at the end and map it to infinity value, such as sum or multiplication of infinite number of values, which might relate to average and geometric average at octave Y (vs. X inside) and map them to finite numbers. Still, without having mappings of variables inside them, as they can be unbound variables in our regards; we do map relations we can find. Without any relations, we take the numbers at face value, such as AAA and AEI, and do operations without noticing that we don't know the relation; for this, they must be heads-up: E refers to posetion or position, A refers to position or negation etc. Then, we use normal relational systems and theorems; we can also use units such as assign unit u1 to first, u2 to second, and u1 * u2 to the multiplication of the two - theorem is rather meaningful if those units are *not our absolute need* and the results might not suffer if we don't have them. We do align the values where those infinities _interact_, this means their relative values give any kind of paradox or coherence with each others, and we use numbers with many unknowns to extract bits, even fractal parts where their positions are not related (using _Second Relational Theorem of Infinity_), but some part of fractal structure gives reference.
