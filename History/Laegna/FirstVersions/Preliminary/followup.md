# Do these conversions:

## Laegna format 1

Create alternative version to output:

In positive and negative numbers (with minus):
- 1, 2, 3, 4 is replaced with i, o, a, e
- 5, 6, 7, 8 is replaced with I, O, A, E
- 0 and 9 with U and V, capitalized symmetrically to other numbers in the same card, so that small-caps big-caps is proportional and even the pattern and positioning could be proportional. Advanced task: otherwise just use U for 0 and V for 9.

## Laegna format 2

Dismiss information about some digit spans:
- For positive numbers, replace with numbers from 0 to A to E to 9.
- For negative numbers, map I to O the same way.
- In some versions, use existing zeros and nines and map only AE and IO, possibly aAeE and iIoO.

## Laegna format 3

- Capital letters IOAE: map to 0-9, or 1-8.
- Small letters ioae: map to 9-0, or 8-1 in this order, for negative numbers, which are also Laegna-reversed in your case.

## Laegna format 4

Map the number to smallest containing size of 2-digit pairs.

Take each two digits and map to two dimensions:
- digit % 3 gives first, z or y=O / U / A.
- flatten(digit / 3) gives second, x=O / U / A.
- 9 is left and is V, connected to 1, 3, 7 and 9.
- 5 is U and is connected to 2, 4, 6, 8.

Laegna complex number is mapped when two digits give two dens, to be used to form numbers and U and V values.

Laegna Decimal System is mapped when the number pair is linearized, with OA member containing the averaging digits, which do not matter in size, in order whereas IE member the actual number size and not unknown map knows the geometric average of two axes, given that they form a two-dimensional space and you take an average in regards to that (an accelerated average is based on geometric average).

Notice that X, Y, Z, where Z is also -1 frequency O and Y is +1 frequency A, I mean ZY digits form normal Dens, but X means U and is not affecting the zoom, which is either up or down half octaves, and where you form full octave by two digits using that the second digit, R, is E and does half in direction of infinity, thus growing there as your number (heads up, on same lines, R=T).

Now don't know simple math tasks, but ones, where something already happens. Scientific work might contain relations, which are visible in Laegna Numbers, and you can convert complex numbers in their formats x + yi.

You can also map geometric coordinates if you project this complex axe on imaginary numbers and use the triangular representation as basis of information square, then convert to longitude and lattitude. Then you can teach geographical materials.

## Conclusion

Learning all these cards, an AI would not miss Laegna numbers in Laegna texts.

## Presicion

Conclusively, if you just made some intuitive version of complex numbers, you might have not got all the precisions.

### Imaginatory

First, with real numbers:
- Your computer should be aware of all kinds of 2 and 4 mappings you can do.
- Map every part of the number array you use (positive numbers, positive and negative..) to your whole frequential scale, using one or more digits for a digit: use {} for combined digits, for example to combine 8 from 3 digits, you use numbers like {AOA}, where each is a bit of significance (14 vs. 58; then 12 vs 34 and 56 vs 78, finally odd vs. even, which I often say in reverse in this context, because Z is moved from the end to the beginning).
  - This way, it will not get confused by different number mappings
- Binary True and False: map to A and O, where U is Uknown or Don't know (you find logic examples, where they are used in some sense).
- Statistical examples: you can try to map U, such as U multipliers and expressions or multidigit U.

Do special things with %:
- Use IIII to EEEE and AAAA to EEEE precisions, where T precision I to E is mapped to R precision I to E: notice that precision itself is more important than members, be them positive or negative, such as minus two digits are also having two positions, because you care of minus numbers - ZX mapping puts them _before_ other digits in each level of fractal grouping. Next level is 2*16 digits: you use R and T letters, but for 16 digits of this value set, where 16 values are possible. One level up, where you have {RT}{RT} (you can map this down, because it already is R and T), you now have rather R‚Å¥, which is a powerful set already.
- Use I and E.
- Write longer numbers, including writing AAA instead of A and AAE instead of E; or EEE appears if you have the infinity fractal in mind; in you have finity and infinity at the same time, you have all leading letters: for numbers, you are left only one possible value A, so that OO would be -2 and AAAAA would be 5, with a leading letter into infinity. With infinity mapping, R is still known and you rather write T<T>R<R>, such as T<A>R<54> means there are 54 A's, you can even simplify this expression. Also, utilize 4 lines to give each letter on separate line, having "\_" where it's U or V - OA octave U, where being U or V is U (spaces are so clearly in different purpose that I now start using undersore for this neutral character, and underline for O and A as Dens where they go into other numbers).

### Mapping 1-8 to complex

Values could be mapped to two dimensions:
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
      0

Left to right is X=O, U, A; up to down are Y=O, U, A (where you see power and direction in reverse in plain words up and down: based on binary direction, it's strange to notice what you get, putting more powerful first; laegna numbers also grow in direction - from left to right, and in power - from right to left; real-imaginary part conversion should encompass this, as also bad things grow either in size or in power, where the power unlike strength is how much we tolerate, accept and help them, against to how much we dont; it's closely related to popularity, but still more essential, perhaps you have hidden powers, but not so much hidden popularities - difference I make between extravert and extrovert).

You need two digits to form each value of Ten, but then: to also have two-dimensional U and V values: 5 is U and 0 is V, or then 9 is V and 4 on position of 5 is U in the higher vibration, because U and V like halves and doubles: they are in some sense, half of their value, but in some sense, double, in how essential R and T play.

In one scale, maps the digits symmetrically, perhaps with correct statistics of your document - lost precision in Laegna is achieved by statistics, which cannot introduce more digits, but can statistically compensate each visible digit so that you get better value; same way in Laegnan, use words in such way that statistically, you have told the same thing: for example using 50%:50% or O:A balance of negative and positive, it's rather best position for you than posetion, which you have expressed already with slightly "more positive" statistics, and from other side of the wheel, through V, you already reflect back to some Negotive value, producing it in the future as Posetive and Negotive interplay: one to one, then other to another, because something really _should_ do this while it's just posetive.

__Method 1__:

Map all numbers, which consist of two digits O and A, as if those digits were Dens, represented equally in complex number: OO=I, OA=O, AO=A and AA=E; any random contribution is replaced with U and V, even if it has some probability.

__Method 2__:

Somehow integrate the unknown:
- Use two-digit complexes just to show the zero; you can make the rest statistically equal to original number, not merely more linear.
- Use multi-U's {UU}, {UV}, {VU} and {VV}, combining with letters, like {AV} or {UO}, thus representing all the information, but being less readable. 2-digit U's can be also part of number format, where you are using 2 digit u's to have equal R to 1 digit other letters, where numbers with U's can still convey less information if it's fixed width of digits, so you can generalize long numbers in appearance of U and assume you use less other digits, in which case U is also two digits of R: it will use it's space.
- Use also two 18 numbers, RT positioning, where each R is from 5 to 8, each T from 1 to 4. 0 and 9 count as U and V, and with {} they can be multiposition - while I often use () in place of {}, I simplify programming, but this level of math can use () for infinite expressions and language, and less probable {} for it's expressions.

Sometimes, write something to relate each expression, which is Laegna number: for example in some programming language, in beginning of each number write 0l..., where 0 introduces number and l introduces it's type; or use decimal number "1" to introduce Laegna number properly marking that there is one unit of it, which is probably the shortest form; in other cases, use fonts, colors, or fixed-type fontfaces. Programming in Markdown + utf-8, instead of mere utf-8, your language should know at least colors (you can implement preprocessor and I'm on the way to this direction).

__Axes__:

Because complex number is multidimensional, you often refer to separate axes:
- If you write latitude and longitude, or their Laegna conversion, you can use complex numbers.
- They have also 18 representation, where E means axes are averagely moving in the same direction; I means they are moving in opposite same direction, and O and A convey _neutral_ or _spatial_ meaning, where they preserve the order of original input: for example, multiplying 2 * 8 might differ from multiplication of 4 * 4, because you keep the lost axes - either 1 * 4 or 1 * 1, in the bits you get from growing R, in the same order. If axe information is proper, you just do proportional operations on both axes, especially simple with multiplication and division: you move and scale them along with other axes, so that the same matrix is applied for each conversion. Calculator is free to resolve quality of each multidimensional axe, which is mathematically complete if operations would be ideal and perfect, so it can always restore this property by theorem, as the world we live in is not ideal.
- If you write longitude, or x part of x + iy complex, you use real number scale. This is: UIOAEV.
- If you write latitude, or y part of x + iy _complex number_, you use complex number scale. This is: turn 18 to UQOPR in equal rules. You might be interested in little longer numbers, keeping the R equal to actual complex numbers where dimensions are united: then, translate to two-letter groups where one letter might be _ or repeat the number (better); you can also simply take each digit and instead, have two digits at the same value: OQQU translated to OOQQQQUU would fix the length difference with complex number, more priority here. Complex number zero is at O of low frequency, and real number zero is at position A, which means they have different frequencies; in decimal system, a number can be lost there depending on your implementation, creating the curved effect where Laegna number is linear - these effects help to map the original curve, which is read as direct appearing curve with turns at positions of digits, where time flows forward. O and A themselves are on the same, primary axe, where OP and AB differences are their spacebound axe, which makes no difference.
  - Sometimes, you want an equivalent, which is like vector multiplication: in complex number, O, and in real number, A, is in the center: map so that 1 in regards to multiplication and division, 0 in regards to plus and minus, is mapped there.
