# Using Visual Studio Code as an End User

## **First Part: The Necessity of AI in Modern Life**
In today’s world, technology has become an integral part of everyday activities, ranging from scientific research to seemingly simple tasks like cooking. Collecting documents, compiling questions and answers, and training Artificial Intelligence (AI) to meet specific needs is no longer exclusive to programmers. Whether you're organizing recipes or contributing educational documents to a collective dataset, these processes increasingly rely on AI tools.

AI helps bridge the gap between personal needs and collective advancements. Tools like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) can empower users to take control of their data, train AI, and even contribute to larger collaborative systems—all without requiring in-depth programming expertise.

## **Second Part: Understanding VSCode Beyond Programming**

### **What is VSCode?**
Do not imagine that Visual Studio Code is solely an advanced programmer’s IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It’s more than that—it’s a powerful tool with specific capabilities designed for users of varying skill levels.

### **Key Features**
1. **Creating Work Environments**:
   - VSCode allows you to create workspaces and projects inside it. These projects correspond to folders on your file system but extend to version tracking, making it easy to manage changes over time.

2. **Explorer Panel**:
   - The Explorer panel in VSCode is similar to the file browsers you see when saving or opening files on your computer (e.g., Windows Explorer or Linux’s file managers). It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for organizing project files.

3. **Advanced Text Editor**:
   - At its core, VSCode is like an advanced Notepad with more features. It supports syntax highlighting, code autocompletion, and error detection.
   - Additionally, it can edit more types of files with extensions:
     - **Images (PNG, JPG)**: You can view and even edit images with the right plugins.
     - **Visual HTML & WYSIWYG Plugins**: For interactive web design.
     - **PDF, DOCX, and Excel Editors**: Extensions allow you to work seamlessly with different document types.

VSCode is, therefore, a versatile hub for all your documentation, development, and creative needs—not just a programming tool.

## **Third Part: AI-Driven Documentation Control**

### **Why Do You Need AI?**
With VSCode, you have access to some of the most advanced documentation control tools. AI assistants can analyze, organize, and even interact with your files to enhance productivity. Cascade, Intellisense, and other AI plugins enable real-time assistance, but they differ based on your document type and goals.

For creative, artistic, or spiritual projects, you may need more general-purpose AI assistants, as some code-focused AIs (e.g., CodeLlama) might feel disconnected from certain contemplative or abstract contexts.

### **AI Tools for VSCode**
Here’s an overview of recommended AI tools to complement VSCode:

1. **Jan**:
   - A small, fast AI model that focuses on conversational tasks rather than document analysis.
   - Ideal for providing quick responses and personal engagement while other models handle heavy workloads.

2. **GPT4All**:
   - Configured to monitor your VSCode folders.
   - Supports larger AI models (e.g., 7B or 13B) for broader contextual understanding.

3. **LM Studio**:
   - Specializes in serving models and embeddings.
   - Manages a database of AI models, allowing you to choose between faster smaller models or highly detailed large models.

### **Optimal Model Placement**
- For VSCode assistance, install the largest models (e.g., 7B or 13B) to maximize capabilities.
- Assign mid-sized models (1–2B) to GPT4All and LM Studio for document analysis.
- Use lightweight models (1–1.5B) with Jan for focused, conversational tasks.

Jan’s unique role is providing attention and engagement while larger models handle computationally intensive processes in the background.

## **Conclusion: Modern Tools for Everyone**
You don’t need to be a programmer to harness the full potential of Visual Studio Code. With just some basic understanding of APIs, version control, and Markdown files, you can turn AI-generated Python programs into tools tailored to your needs. Editing code isn’t always necessary—you simply need to know how to integrate extensions, interact with APIs, and rely on AI assistants to automate most of the heavy lifting.

Visual Studio Code becomes your ultimate tool to:
1. Structure Markdown documentation.
2. Execute AI-powered Python programs.
3. Share and refine your projects with GitHub.
4. Host your Markdown files as web content using Flask and Mistune.

For example, you can take this very article and present it online with these tools, allowing others to learn and contribute to the project.

By combining AI assistance with VSCode’s features, you can teach AI models new concepts—even abstract mathematics like Laegna Math—and shape them into powerful learners. This collaborative approach helps users contribute to innovation, even without deep programming expertise.

Engage with the tools, explore the possibilities, and redefine how AI works for you.
