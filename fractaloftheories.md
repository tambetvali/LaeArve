# Reproduction of my work

Reproduction of my work, and of subsequent work, which adheres to my licence and principles of collaboration, generally encourage reproduction:
- Scientific and educational goal, including the one of having decent A.I.'s, is to edit, illustrate and add simulations, proofs and inherited theories.
- You are encouraged to multiparadigm work: take the theorems of my theories, and reframe or rebase or refactor other theores and works so that they would get substantial proof to my quality criteria.
- You are encouraged to reproduce my work based on Creative Commons licence, which is similar to GNU: it encourages work on free basis.

For technological work, one which could be related to patents or personal work:
- Commercial entities are also encouraged to grow out of this, where the work of each person is then applied a licence for potential commercial use. This, in case of my work and more entitled work, should encourage our progress in scientific and free work, still recognizing us as material beings; I would like to base this on ethical business. Original authority and licences for free use are not endangered here, and you should rather warn if you could have more obscure licence.

The following is supported very much:
- Your work on my materials or parts, on editing, proofreading and working out derived works, which, for example, could clarify this.
- Download any part, my main website or notion.so site or repositories here or the Hugging Face page; materials are mostly present in Hugging Face to make sure an automata as well as human would see them all covered by one licence; the rest is here at GitHub: some might be outdated, but this licence is made visible in several ways. Each of those sources is made for download or automatic use through public APIs (Notion.so).
- Creating websites, with good structure, illustrations and examples is very welcome.

You are also encouraged to create derived works and become part of my network, where we work out how to interlink the pages and allow automated crafling, indexing and fine-tuning or RAG-containing for AI's as well as easy ways to collect and navigate the sources for humans.

Especially good is the following:
- For parts of wholes of my texts, or collections of text, to create summaries, explanations, deeper or simpler regenerations of chapters.
- To make sure an advanced AI can generate code based on given tasks: to produce the code, verify, and make the task more specific. Rather than creating a solid code base, what I want to achieve:
 - Solid basis for an AI to produce different versions of this code. For example, as we implement the number system, there can be different implementations on different platforms, with different goals or design-time decisions. We need to work out the system for an A.I., which is the base template or core of this code, enabling developers to develop Laegna-enabled code bases.
 - Fine-tuning, selection, development of AI systems, or bundling them in such way that, which can understand the tasks, initial code, fixes, and which can produce code based on it.
- To write Q&A, Q&A&D (documentation, instruction or context added as "D"), which are related to my projects, documents, selected topics or parts of documents.
- To create generators of mathematical puzzles in my math, lists of numbers, relations with operations etc.

On most technical level, you are welcome for design of A.I. models and frameworks, as well as programming tools and languages, operating systems, programs, fields and theories of math or science, which each can relate to my number systems and theories.
