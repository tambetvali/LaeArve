# Why I need to generate data for an AI to learn

Here is the feedback from the Cascade, an AI I'm using with CodeLlama 7b and 13b, depending on how much time I have to wait for an answer (usually around hour here without internet, but I'm also not working faster and I used to wait like this for my old modem, to download something considerable from internet):
AI comment: """It sounds like you are describing a project that involves creating a website for generating math problems and answers, with the goal of making it easy for users to interact with the website using an AI language model. The website would generate a large number of math problems in the form of JSON objects, which the user could then use as input for their AI language model. This would allow the user to train their own AI language model on the generated data, and potentially achieve better results than training on a small dataset.

It's interesting that you are considering using an AI language model in this context, as it allows for more creative and innovative applications of math. However, it's also important to note that the user may need to have some programming skills to use the generated data effectively with their AI language model. Additionally, it's worth noting that generating a large number of math problems in JSON format could be computationally intensive, and may require significant resources to process and generate.

Overall, it sounds like you are on the right track with your project idea, and I hope this gives you some inspiration for your work!"""

My answer for this:
- Classical math has many inspiring problems and solutions, so that from the collection, an AI would learn math.
- My math is really innovative and AI models I have tried just *overlook* the content, such as missing the concrete numbers and confusing with other numbers.
- Thus, it's important, until there are more handmade materials, to create the generative feeds of data, which can be learnt - as I'm solving some new problems, they don't exist in the problem set and no AI, of the ones I tried - like GPT-mini with context awareness of my docs - would *not* understand my complex relations.

Thus, as I have my own mathematics - I have to work alone, and I don't produce so many pages myself. I try to be creative about the puzzle generation and add my inspiration, but particularly I need to show it my own calculator - once it has ran through the combinations, perhaps it would understand the content of my text, including the numeric examples (not English - where in reading, an AI falls into something like habit or track of considering my examples with English or just plain old math, where I have given a concrete example and it can understand most proofs, but unless I'm very particular to ask about specific sentence, it would read that I equals minus 2 and minus infinity in given context of my math, but then - from some old programming manual, still tell me for example that it could be "input", or it could be unknown; sometimes it feels poetic, sometimes just plain wrong, but never like concrete math in all those examples). Thus, to achieve something, I need to allow it to get the mechanical database - my math is quite creative, but I also have the aspect, which is more like mechanical; once it understands the rigid rules of my numbers - qualitatively different from decimal system -, it could also at least be able to concentrate on some background of my more creative solutions and introduce it properly to others without plain nonsense - me alone, I have tight time limits and I cannot produce so many pages of creative text, despite having some ideas.

The fine-tuning with my own numbers and primitives should give the following effect:
- I am choosing the basic set of numbers, which are most regular. Given certain number types, they provide regular solutions just like basic four operations, matrices, vectors and their basic operations in classical math, which are quite trivial to solve each once you have an algorithm, and one cannot be very creative - to multiply matrices, for example, you rather have some basic operations and that's it.
- I write more creative texts for more creative topics over time, for example I have a website with deeper content. It gets to philosophy, science and scientific modification of spirituality with more scientific definitions and strict proofs; an AI is able to understand them, still I have also the math of infinities, which for me is quite regular, but very big theory - for an AI, it appears to be absolutely irregular. Its analogue in classical math is solving integrals and differentials - somewhere, a simple formulas might appear, but as much as I understand and in my case, where the acceleration and velocity and how to convert from one to another is kind of simple when done geometrically or by basic logic - the symbolic and abstract solutions do not have so straightforward rules, but rather need creative selection between theorems. The automate solvers are quite powerful, and they all know symbolic math not just number arithmetics - like a matrix multiplicator or even a program to take matrix determinant, which based on "Oxford User's Guide to Mathematics" I myself solved with just a few lines of Python, even if some other introductions make me rather confused, without a clear and solid algorithm. My own math, the same way, can make some people just confused - but with an AI, if the basic combinations, including implications through several proofs and operations, become more trivial, and the number logic is more obvious, it would also understand my wider implications without much guessing.
- Once this is done, I feed it more creative text, such as scientific, philosophical and scientifically spiritual topics, and I hope that knowing the basic words such as basic number theory, algorithms and combinatorics of numbers, by autogenerated examples - and by definitions, it cannot learn them by my experience, while I don't have experience with GPT-4 but most of us are still not able to run much more than GPT-2 given that we want to do fine-tuning -; once it has learnt the basics, like the primitives - it would, based on the words, be able to understand the sentences.

An AI understood this text that I'm connecting everyday life with math; while the system might contain
linguistic and rather poetical or "spiritual" aspects in the future, our goal with creating this is
most definitely to make it understand strict math:
- The aspect we are interested about in this system is development of strict math teacher for an AI with clear and rigid definitions.
- Other aspects are interesting, but poetry is not the main idea of this system - even if, with infinities, certain aspects of poetry, life, emotions or spirituality are more clear: our math contains rather more heavily a concept of *wholeness*, which appears within infinities without an effort; for example "love", even "brotherhoods" are rather mystical things, and not all the people believe in love in sense of it having any purpose behind trivial biology, such as deep experiences; not all the people believe in Truth and not many believe that in systems, the parts interact with the whole, which can be disregarded as spirituality. In math of infinities, those aspects become rather algorithmic and we can speak the "cold" scientific language (which many don't believe, who believe in love) about these topics, for example comparing both synergy and synchronicity with multivariable equation systems - ones, where solutions for single variables lead to local optimums, but the "global optimum" or the solution of the system itself, not it's separate parts, can be compared to love: interaction between the parts becomes bigger than the case of analyzing separate equations of the equation system, which give rather random local optimums with small benefit. Regular infinities with size, scope and other properties of numbers can exist along with limits, which are rather abstract directions than particular values of the position, for example:
* Divide 5 by infinity.
* Divide the result by zero.
* If infinity and zero were concrete values, they would also be opposites in sense of division, as they are formed as opposites - instead, the result is unknown, which means while the unknowns are clearly opposite unknowns, we cannot identify behaviours of values inside, especially their symmetries.
Other example:
* When velocity is changing rapidly, acceleration curve gives "impossible" or "unknown" values.
* The paradox: tangent of acceleration curve, which should be unknown given the unknown value, is having concrete and clear values, thus also the numbers whose tangent it is must be comparable in reality.
Physical example:
* Speed of Light and the distance travelled, where we become flat in terms of visible coordinate system, not being able to move further; Einstein described those. Without involving that there are relative properties of infinities, such as relative infinity: in terms of speed, you can infinitely approach it, but given you do not have equally infinite acceleration, you cannot pass an infinite speed in math theory, where mathematically you can describe surpassing speed of light; about the distance holds the same: while you have equations and boundaries, you don't have the basic math primitive to describe such thing in essence. In Infinity math with proper constants, rather the numbers themselves have this property - in this case, you simplify the equations, which are now rather *symmetric to some numbers* than merely an artificial construct in regards to number theory.
* Zeroes: they have similar property that what we see as solid, is actually made of particles and atoms; given that zero is absolute value, this is rather observation of something unknown; given that in mathematics, the zeroes have similar properties, it would be an observation which can be mapped into theorem-based, not experience-based field of math (we don't even care whether this math exists there in real form, but we care that we can describe equivalent effect with basic math, and thus we rather have an expressive system - while some of my described infinities might be actual infinities, others might be numbers with other qualities with properties of infinity, where making the difference is rather philosophical, but having the math framework with such *simplified* concepts is important).
* Ethics: our ethical theory, to hold, must be *completely flat*, this means we rather compare to infinity values, than anything with beginning and end in time and space; for example, we do not have specific deadline, where we would stop surviving as a species because ethics ends there - rather, if however far in time we would sense our ethics fails, then while it's not urgent practical necessity, in regards to ethics we do not have a measure how long we should foresee, but rather "long term" would extend to anything we can calculate, and consequently the formulae itself is completely flat, where each variable is eternal and not related to something inside time; for example, we rather prepare to get friends with aliens, should we see them, and we do not have a theory that when humans meet another race, they should be unprepared; even if we only protect ourselves, we are rather sure that we would protect ourselves in any future - this means, in infinity. Indeed, if another species would be much more than us, maybe it would also be ethical to not stand on their way.
