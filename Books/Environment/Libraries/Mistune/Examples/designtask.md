Now a parser, which works along with this Mistune class:
- It can understand our special syntax, such as more than 6 "#"'s in a row, where it starts a subdocument, and having # levels backwards: if higher levels are there before first lower levels, they are appended to last paragraph and sublevel of titles themselves are made, but the H levels appended backwards.
- It can find chapters "#" and blocks ">" with our special @ or @@ in the beginning along with link, also special code blocks inline and exline, which start with paragraph law symbol. It can understand from markdown, if proper titles or ">" blocks appear inside of something, and it uses Mistune library for this.
- Special code, also links and other things can run code: this can process parts of markdown file in more easily understandable format where their things: title levels and associated text positions, blocks starting with "!", "?", "@", "@@", are visible; it also allows creation of submodules of same parent class, which allow more parsing: each gets a property in markdown template, added to global properties and accessible to it; it can find blocks from blocklist or by character position, assigning rather than appending; they return variables and markdown: this markdown can be linked, or somehow attached, and it's added inside the property and not directly to markdown, so that all it's structure is preserved.
- Finally, it can include linked markdown by "@" or by linking back from other connected websites, and have pre-processor of same kind on this Markdown.
- It can append linear set of batches to markdown, which add or remove parts, block whose beginning character, and block whose ending character is used is added from blocklist, where executed code output or included other Markdown is added
- For nested file link structure more than 6 levels, where nested file is on sublevel, only 6 levels are included: garbage collector removes subsequent, and leaves a link to the page with longer list
- It supports Garbage Collector: a system, which blocks and links the chapter trees below 6 levels or longer text and more chapters.
