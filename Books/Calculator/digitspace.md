# Digit Space

I think we leave the digit space to calculator - it will do this operation on trivia basis, with very simple numbers, which might not be even Laegna numbers yet; perhaps it's using the computer's native data types in it's implementation, where upper types are to be built on.

By _coordinate correspondence theorem of infinity_, we can map digital systems so that we are free from limitations of certain digit systems: for example, in my given example in Python, we add one digit value to decimal system, and map this with frequencies.

We use discrete digit mapping of infinities, and also we need to notice the spatial correspondence we used in frequential transform example - code.md in microAI book (MDMicrobot, almost like a microbe, but kind of context-aware theory in practice of awareness and attention, as it can be small context of different conditions, especially if I manage to make it shorter - this is 5-parameter microbot, where the next layer could be 7-parameter; I mean it has one major and 5 minor theorems of infinity, where the rest 4 are not so much for calculator than for computer, and I would rather make separate tagging or keep a copy of it, which is free from those, to learn exactly the basic numbers, even while it's theory utilizes each theorem and method):

By discrete mapping:
- Each digit is able to participiate not only in value system, but in dimensional system; each added frequency, each added data density bit would "manually" change the data scope. Notice this is frequential system at X or Z; we can have space-separated numbers at Y as well, and we can use accents in digit positions to have it happen in value space which is then rather Z in zoom.

For example:
OA OA OA - two frequencies happen at Z or X; this is the frequency vibration ("vibration" means there are several frequencies in regards to the frequential space / the "zero-space" we use).
OOO AAA - the same two happen at infinity vibration, thus it's rather smooth growth, but with the same number value.

OAOAOA and OOOAAA thus, they create the same value effect at Z and Y, whereas IOIEAE maps to complex, but nice set of local vibration along with global vibration, but R positional space maps to R value space and T positional space to T value space - with 4-digit or 16-digit symmetric groups, indeed, we would not have the little discrete mapping effect:
- IOIOAEAE - the local vibration.
- IIOOAAEE - the infinite equivalent.

This, then, depends on your mapping: if we map E as 2 in regards to A as 1, the smooth transition would be more powerful; but remember if we divide this by 2, using IE in literally accelerated form, the acceleration component slows down and is equal to velocity component, where `18` particularly `1458` / `1448` is the range, which allows for compensation of these component effects. In `18` conversions we move digits through octaves: we lose _all_ precision if we do this, but instead we append these digits to other end of the number within frequential logic, so it's really eternal even in math - some value over space and time. We do this by a theorem that number exists inside rather ideally continuous fractal number space: when we zoom in or out, the fractal repeats, following the theorem that without having R equal to T, the number would have distortion; this property has Ta√π: it can have _loan_, in sense that the non-local information needs to be studied and estimated; rather, in math, we do it with numbers we have.

Notice:
- We can change number power in each direction.
- If it's more than one direction, the number of combinations of digits in multiplication operation would exponentially grow, for example 1, 2, 4, 16 dimensions means 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th power of exponential factor in how many combinations we do - with only one digit, indeed it's zero, because we do just one combination, if the digit itself is also one, we don't do any operation at all, while in Laegna, "AA" * "AA" can multiply rather R and give "AAAA" - while it's still 1 or 0, more occurrences of it bring the actual value closer to limit value and thus, we have coordinate space mapping in four directions - superscript and subscript numbers on both sides of the number, digits on the both side of the digit.
- Notice: the same time, as addition and subtraction come closer to their limit of one or zero, relatively their power shrinks when adding operatos; for example, AA+AA is having container R (the one in EE+EE) growing by 1 bit, so it happens on imaginary space; but AAAA+AAAA have also one bit, which is now relatively much smaller so it's _approaching it's smallness_, in relation. What is growing is rather the number of possible combinations between all digits, which we _won't do_ - a neutral number would have bigger numbers add more digits, but even five million digit a would have only one digit dimensional expansive when the same sized number is added.

Discrete mappings:
- Adding each digit, we add dimension.
- Having limited, discrete number of those digits, even having each external component for infinity: relatively, with E we approach infinity, where the angle is equal and also for E we expect, for symmetric axes, to have two times less relative input.

## Stock Market Theory

While you have the statistical calculations of things like growth factors, you might have combined all the ways you can see the equation, and tried each combination of positions of three variables, solving equations of how to put them on both sides of the equation mark.

You might not have, as I, given a special attention to this property:

When you have growth of certain stock in 4 months by 4 units, it's equal to having 1 months by 1 units: the angle is equal (let's call it T as in number t value). Still, each month you need to buy a new stock. In Laegna we call this relation "E" and "EEEE", where they are the same number with different R values. While the book was a valuable source of inspiration, I'm not sure if the actual operation of Laegna invariance is directly this - in what I'm sure, if you find this book (quite thin, and the author talks about the same little equation so long that you might get bored), then you would understand the important property.

Notice: in Laegna, we can make use of just "adding" variables together, why we use the word "String" for both base type of Number and base type of Text, which then cannot be just abstract "String": "E" $* 4 ("E" string-times 4) gives us "EEEE", if the variables are context-relevant. We manipulate separate R and T and in some coordinate system levels of transformations, we even make E digit go towards multiplication in addition and vice versa, where their relative distance is bigger, which is compared to their simpler behaviour.

In our case, the property is, and where it's far from the theory in the book by utilizing T and R so that you won't even see any more the parallel with stolastick:
- Infinity, really, is _undefined_ as a number.
- It exists most seriously in two ways:
  - As a frequential pattern of the number or it's outcome.
  - By digits themselves becoming not only _smaller_, but _thinner_ as we go to other octave.
  - By fractalizing the number.
  - By not compressing it, even if compressed numbers are not different by a special rule.
  - There are more considerations hidden into Laegna interplay with infinities, where you see only an unified framework, kind of "API" to a very powerful number space, when compared to binary system.
