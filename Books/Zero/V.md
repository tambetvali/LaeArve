# ☸ V as in Vendetta

Well, joking: V as as in digit divider.

Think of number V:
- It's outside, but it's still having plus, minus, multiplication and division on two axes, or in denary which is abstract operation dimension, where we keep R of number and assume two components are having the same value, for example ideals have the same value for being both future and past aligned, and little different for having only past of only future aligned.
- It's as if Zero was a number: then it would have sub-one size. Taking it away would create it's opposition: from Ù we rather simplify into I, where we take it away two times to not have small-frequency values not below, but inside-below, which would mean we use multifrequential number; for one-frequential number: if it's the only digit, then indeed, the number is what it is in _any_ frequency.

Matrix problem of projecting the space could also be solved with frequencies.

Inside V, we have minus value of it: IO and plus AE. _Closeness_, to the center, is still an opposite of the one for Zero: I and E are _close_, while O and A are _far_. We have, in one octave up, from IOAE to 09, or actually 18 (1 to 8, where forward-dimension in my numbers and words is alway time, or frequency where we measure past in here in low frequency, and future in here in high frequency, to measure how we progress towards it: we might live forever lives, but have _no future_ or _no past_: when we reevaluate the past and renew our support in modified basis, slowing down for those who are now negotive and speeding up to the posetive - "to" and "the", in Laegna, is Position - To in two letters - and the, which is theorem-parallel-exponent, where the latter then is Posetion yes, but also on accelerated axe where it's true; we draw some parallels to Latin, where we take posetion binarically: while we cannot do Laegna calculations in binary we can know the binary for "too much", and subsequentially map it's theorems to such mapping).

Now this V gives us the actual V on complex space: a division. We use it because of close meaning and form, where the sharp end can also be posetive, pass the infinity, and thus map in reverse in single dimension: into upside-down U. But V is also a separation, and we can see separation falls into this range:

Write IOAEIOAEIOAEIOAE vector (with frequential axes, each more powerful than the last, but half octaves down it's rather linear) or IOAE IOAE IOAE IOAE (matrix: each digit could be extended into a number, where subdigit numbers map into one digit above, but their R relations are seen _inside their precision_, where each can be compared with it's own R; oscillating, they form the same number: either successful local repetition, or a global optimum). In Laegna linear dimension, they are measured equally: to map this back, we can use decimal representation where the angular dimension is slower; we can use projections, where we map it so that addition is mapped to _slow_ dimension, while multiplication is mapped to _expanding_ dimension, and the _order_ of digits is preserved, as well as inside shape of the angle. For example, if we turn in degrees, when coming from center, and five times we go forward, turn 5 degrees, forwards, turn 5 degrees back...; then, it's equal if you multiply the shape by 5 and express so the global angle.

For given number, the first 4 is opponent of the last 4, while inside, first the digits are opponents and then the numbers.

In Laegna system, we do not account whether the opposition is 1 or 2-dimensional: otherwise, scaling and panning the number we have added and multiplied to, would make the first factor grow linearly and the second exponentially; given the _size_ of a point affects any dimension, including the ones we don't see.

Why patterns are reflected through dimensions?
- For frequential numbers, we need alignation of number and size of digits for different frequencies, if we want the number form to remind of Fourier Transform, which allow to explain one property (R) through another (T) and thus, in Laegna-simplified form but perhaps containing all the complexity, it maps why the number T reflects into infinity in R, the position which is seemingly one digit: but the value, where the written digits are the same, with Y (R), map up from X (T - where Z might be S as it approaches like Ś could do, each negative number recovering and positive accelerating, as in sinus and cosinus: where you see, while the negative and minus negative number map the deduction or lack of it, and their growth maps 8 squares, square in eighth order, which must be doubled to also go equal amount through position dimension, to map it's letter Á, a with upwards accent, which means it's on this position accelerating towards that other; the number part is with small letter shape, but capital letter size, opposite of small-caps, which before number maps to direction of infinity window).

How you see numbers?
- They are part of different dimensions coming from somewhere, going to somewhere.
- Each point has value.
- With Fourier Transform, you could see that as you depict the number, you saw only a small part of it's value window. Each number is part of chain of consequence and effect, where it might map from reaction to change of initial input. You get one window from there, which has: range and digit value. It's part inside bigger range and digit value, where you use spaces to separate numbers, and 3 or 5 or 6, or 2 for Z and X / R and T, to map the synchronicity of the number.
- Laegna number has also the window, and is number deduction of such transformation: added in a row, they are similar to number.

As each two digits maps acceleration by difference of two digits, so they form zero; it holds inside dimensions, where 1 and 2 map together: but you can divide them into two frequencies, you see square view and linear view, where you have operation: one digit is transformed into two in backwards-operation, and two into one in forewards.
- Often, we know the ranges of possible inputs and outputs, and rather we have the digit values.
- Where the digit values pass the highest dimensions, as switching between 1234 and 5678, value would still contain all digits: what leaves upwards, is added downwards, and vice versa. This is because Z maps Y: if they do not map, you have to do the operation - something like an average of two digits - and you get from ZY to X, where this three maps two octaves of position, so it's multiplication moves the octaves; it's digits also have exponential growth for this purpose. You assume that at least you _measure_ the higher frequency the same way: it's a symmetry which exists in numbers, once you have collected all the consequency upon you and the others.
- _The operation of this chapter_: while two closest digits are mapped together, they form apart-opposites: pairst of digits, which would give the same number for _opposite_ difference. Linearly, IO are against AE, I against O or E (the same distance if no letters between, because you only go in different direction but you measure position, actual shift, in relation to your position: for global to move, big and small would move). The opposite digits, such as 2 against 3, 4 against 5, 6 against 7 (ZXY); on square: the E of first is opposite of the I of the last four, where four times four is square, perfect square for Laegna numbers. So, while O and A are normally separated by U, the being-together, in such the A and E would _be apart_. O and A are very hard to read if you think they are signed: rather, we imagine _something in between_ and have more symmetric number in abstract space; in low frequency it relates how, from minus, you get over to plus; in higher frequency: how, from plus, you would reach multiplication or exponential curve. Both are operations equally complex, and we are yielding about which one we do; also in future Z remains: now "my" viewpoint has to be up, and this upness also up with even smaller accent, sometimes invisible but then U, not O, then we still operate that the _past_, being lower, would not repeat, and being higher - _would_.

When you look at infinity _digitwise_, where the digit at different position:
- You map each of it's symmetries, for example for Laegna number in four digits of it, which is like four infinities in relation to digits. This is the square: square of 2 gives 4, where infinity from 1 to 2 by _reaching_ 2 by multiplication from 1: the _number of operations_ is rather accelerative, where operation _multiply_ with upwards accent let us use the acceleration component of number, which has both: the first A position after this, which gives still A in infinity, where you can see how much R is growing with Plus, where you map E where R is growing with Multiply.

Digit "_":
- We don't have zero, because multiplication and addition have to be free operations: they happen synchronously and only watch a projection of other on their own axe.
- Operations, which do with numbers, do not consider these digits, for example multiplication leaves them out. Only half operations is done, and the resulting range growing by half of it in frequency or e factor, where the digit is also considered to be with half range, thus one digits instead of two. If plus would occur in I and multiplication in E, they would be indeed positive factors; but for number with same number of digits: I, then, when it's approaching to 1, from a digit whose value could be a little more, when you add all digits, even if they are equivalent. You see a relation to how many digits you add to resulting number if you multiply or add, where you use etalons: the digit size is growing by the amount, where you add or multiply two equal numbers, by which the value of I is changing, where U or 0 would be the current length and V would be right after where it's doubled in multiplication; it would close the box: our values are infinity-symmetrix, as 4, so the 6; and also ZXY, which reflects one octave: transformation to have this octave symmetry in two frequencies, one half the power of other, leaves us with symmetric operations and thus, does not confuse the optimizer, which can put many dimensions together and still have meaningful ranges: if you lack one dimension globally, locally you lack your own dimension as well, as it kind of owns, it would be optimized if it goes that other dimension up, and it's deoptimized by a degree by which it went down, given the Position always means a Position: rather, you look different forces of them, and use a frequency fractal to see that zero might mean they use energies in opposite direction, or they do not use energies, or they use counterenergies in opposite (inwards) direction, or they use completely another energy. In your realm, it actually matters as it would do it's operation in infinity, or in dimension they perceive as their result.

On diagonals, Laegna number digits have the same length as in horizontals and verticals of square number: also in decimal, write 10 digits on 10 lines to have mapping of each value, where you hardly find symmetric combinations: rather, the combinations behave as if there were non-prime numbers inside, where smaller prime numbers are indeed more efficient (a relation covered in _Pythagorean_ theory of music harmonies, one which aligns with frequential system: the beauty we see is rather mathematical and physical beauty, the beauty of Nature, also it's unity, since we are co-optimized to achieve a common target).
