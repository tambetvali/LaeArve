# Logecs link Marks

To form a proper AI, one shouold be aware of the balance:
- Annotating: content should be properly annotated - clear content by larger or more specific AI, obfuscated content by humans and their conversations to form, at least, some patterns.
- General-purpose learning: content, which is not annotated, should be processed on parallel, space-expanding basis.

# Site markers

Sites are positions, where one might be - with highlighting enabled.

Site might contain such properties:
- X: Container: normally marked by container header - the title on some level is selected, to be used as a context. Z and Y container arrays or split sequences can bring an external window of contextualized, probably in 1-dimensional or n-dimensional container in relation to 1-dimensionality component of dimensionality; dimensionality does not have to be a natural number - it might be zero, fragment number or infinity, or exist in non-linear space (accelerated or deccelerated space or the union space of square center).
- A: Cursor: single position, between two letters, after or before any letter (insert lock off), or on top of any letter (insert lock on). This could have it's internal or inertial, external insert lock. For this, insert focus is on cursor - replacements or add-ons are inserted on top of a letter or between two, in both cases a single position.
- E: Focus: this has beginning and end, on a letter or between two, on synchronized or unsynchronized basis - unsynchronization means, one is on letter and the other is between two letters.
- U, O: various blurred selections of regions defined by approximation. For example, fuzzy search could evoke such markers.
- O: Annotations: positions, which are not centric, and add multiple non-central cursors or markers. Those can have unique identifier, such as a footnote number or letter sequence.
- I: Marker lines, highlights: these are blocks of areas selected in addition to central focus.

While A or E must become visible when link is followed to this target, but X (title), as well as other letters score up in being at correct window, when visible - constraints to zoom and pan are separate; if jump to this far is not allowed, it must occur to closese referrer in local scope (for example, only summaries to link objects are allowed and seen as near counterparts, or links lead to local introductions first: this structure is organized and this can be seen, how the link target is associated with the presentation).

This all can be scriptable or programmable API.

## Site marker concretes

Site markers can be annotiated with final name or association, such as index in a list. Inside document, which is linked, each sequence element comes into play - in locally coherent syntax, which does not blur the file (for example, only a title is marked as the contextual text is known not to change). Markdown-compatible editor, which is able to process this, would be necessary: this structure could show some previous version of file more compatible, and current or last trusted and time-tested version as the most decent for normal life use.

Site markers can use text items to remain moving and persistent in case of copy-pasting, adding and removing letters, unless they are broken: in latter case, result of diff is seen as approximation or near-sure match to this.

They can create database files and become drivers to main files, if compatible OS is used: this API is active in memory, hard drive and internet containments, and exists either in driver (client) or in drived (server).

# Link markers

Named link markers exist:
- They link to particular target, but might use a API of link marker document, an XML. The document could be included: it could replace itself with event controller, and it's actual target as the visible item of the link. In case of copying, perfect functionality would give a choice to use either driver's or target's link, in different relative coordinate systems.

If it contains one link, the link would centralize it's focus, when clicked - for example, title could centralize it's content and open it's attachments as focused context for the panes.
