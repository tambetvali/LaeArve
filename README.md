# Laegna Math Website

My new mathematics is about:
- New Logecs system able to think outside the boundaries of Logic
- Mathematecs better able to solve paradoxes than Mathematics
- Completely fresh, unique view of Zeroes and Infinities, able to tackle problems
- Much more...

This system is going to be:
- Source for information about Laegna Logecs and Mathematecs
- Source for autogenerated puzzles of Laegna Math and Study Cards
- Generator for automatic AI reinforcement / fine-tuning to understand my math and texts

  - Laegna Spireason texts: high complexity, unedited
- https://www.notion.so/Laegna-1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565
  - Source database for creating an AI chatbot about my Theory
  - Initial page, Laegna is about tautological, strict proofs, which do not account of philosophically unclear matters such as cognition
    - Laegna Base Alphabet is page under it, which explains the base language of mine
    - Additional sources refer to different aspects of my theory, scope of it, and some stories to describe social values it is able to resolve (coming from history and experience)
