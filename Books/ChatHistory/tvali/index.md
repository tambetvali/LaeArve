## GPT4All chat about "version 0.1"

GPT4All asked clarification about "what is version 0.1", stating it's unclear.

"version 0.1":
- if you see round numbers, they are most probably generalizations.
- This one is generalization of an "initial version"
- We use metaphors.

For example, if you see "version 0.1.123", it's more probably an actual version or a generalization of higher concept.

Version 0.1 - it's not _less probable_, statistically, to get symmetric numbers, and indeed you reach them in your versions unless you have some kind of 13-rule.

Anyway, it's _as probable_ to find numbers like 0, 1, or 1000000 in contexts, where they refer to either very small, or very big numbers, or other trivial aspect by which they are _unique_, being some of the most symmetric or simplest examples.

Thus, seeing some very simple or very beautiful numbers, such as "0.123456789", which almost definitely refers to something:
- Most probably, they represent a general case of such number.
- If format is _an example_, it often needs names like "John Smith" or IP addresses like 0.0.0.0, or webdomains like http://www.mywebdomain.ai/ - all of them might fake somebody, because really you can register just "mywebdomain", much like you can register "youtube", having nothing to do with "you".
