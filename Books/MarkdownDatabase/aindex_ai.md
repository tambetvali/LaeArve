# ðŸ¤– How Artificial Intelligence should be implemented to Laegna Web Server.

In two ways, database collections, new entries, selections or garbage-collected subsets, could be processed by:
- Python code processing Q&A
- Prolog query to prolog DB data processing Q&A.

What is not Prolog or Python, should have a proper conversion.

Languages should be implemented in small subsets with hidden heading to be imported automatically, creating an attachments folders for files and folders in Spider, for folders inside and for files along with them.
- Implement a small subset, where you can explain a static and correctable version for an user.
- Implement imaginary sets, such as leaving "pass" definitions in python, which would then not process all the data, or marking it to be half-pseudocode prolog or python.
- We like pseudocode, because we are rather programmers as well, and users could have means to express new ideas, for example with their interpretation of functions.
  - AI could very well know, what to do with each task inside, and this is the preferred way: use "TODO:" blocks.

The code to read them:
- Either proper Python or Prolog processor operating on custom code.
- A parser for given subset, which is able to parse with a given template.
  - It has a function to detect if it's it's code; later if it's able to confirm a subset of code along with other supported detectors to allow multiple paradigms.
  - It can execute it fast, for example it uses local Brain & Knowledge database instead of downloading, or understands orders to complex library without having it. We must check the licences of each, still, in regards to the standard, where Python is at least GPL.

For example:
- Each table and it's item is registered with prolog lines, given a tag and a name, such as ObjectMyFile() or ObjectMyFile.InstanceName() or ObjectMyFile(InstanceName). The notation is back-convertible.
- Prolog question could be asked, if prolog has processed the items.

## AI method

Given this, an AI could connect entries with Prolog: for example, understand which ones are better versions of others, which ones are jokes or metaphors aoubt other cards.

Q&A can be properly assembled by an AI, including Q&A&D or any other format the AI would accept.
