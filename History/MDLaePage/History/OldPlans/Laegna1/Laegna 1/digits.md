Laegna Mathematecs starts from the Laegna number system.

### 4 digit system

I wanted to reach the infinity.

I saw in the binary system a magic property - it is not containing infinite number of digits when going through logarithms and exponents. It's only shifted in the code. I saw the number two as magic about infinity, as I need an exponent to reach there.

Thus, I did choose a representation, which has the most important form in four numbers:
* "I" is -2 for whole numbers, and 1 for natural numbers.
* "O" is -1 for whole numbers, and 2 for natural numbers.
* "A" is 1 for whole numbers, and 3 for natural numbers.
* "E" is 2 for whole numbers, and 4 for natural numbers.
* "U" is Zero, but there are lots of paradoxes about zeroes in Laegna, so it's not always there.

### 4 digits for finity and infinity

I see that the numbers 2 and 4 (2 times 2) both reach the relation of infinity.

The relation between 0 and 1 is infinite on axe of division. One has to divide infinitely long to reach 0 from 1, and when they reach that, they are exactly at infinity.

The relation between 1 and 2 is as special. When we think that multiplication always leads upwards, we would need to go infinitely long to reach 2 from 1. This relation from smallest to largest, from 1 to infinity (2-1 is 1, but for numbers, which come later, multiplication goes upwards in straightforward ways and the relation does not need infinity to explain - as they start going upwards on their own, they do not need infinite boost to reach anywhere inside infinity of multiplication and division).

I see that when addition and subtraction occur in finity, the multiplication and division have symmetries with logarithms and exponents - we can reach infinity and pass beyond it with those operations.

Thus, in Laegna:
- The number two is infinity compared to zero, in terms of multiplication and division in relation to 1. It's the only number I found to map infinity to small number. Compared to zero, -2 is another infinity. Natural numbers, without needing to go downwards, reach infinity and there are infinitely many of them - but for whole numbers, it reaches infinity in two directions and thus, it's two times in size.
- The number four, then, symbolizes the whole infinity compared to the half infinity in two; or it symbolizes two infinities compared to one infinity in two. Difference of those two comparisons I call an octave.

To have a perfect projection of infinity, thus, the four numbers and their symmetries are used. Zero is left out, as it would not make us reach infinity in the most direct way.

So the Laegna Real Numbers:
* "I" - minus infinity
* "O" - minus finity
* "A" - finity
* "E" - infinity

I dreamed of infinities in all my life, and this is my solution. With this, I can see degrees in infinities, and I can see, in Laegna system, infinities of different degrees, different lengths.

### Zero

So what's the trick in leaving out the zero?

In decimal system, we go upwards with positive, and downwards with negative numbers.

In laegna system, we won't do that. The numbers, every digit of them, constantly flows upwards - O is not before I, but it's after I; -2 is not after -1, but before it. I see this decimal representation as a paradox - how can -2 be smaller than -1, when 2 is bigger than 1? The paradox is subtle: when doing many operations, we cannot keep track of the directions, as plus and minus appear everywhere, not only near zero; so, the numbers start yielding. I call this "writing on the same line" - in Laegna, I use the word "line" to shift numbers in means of frequencies, but if they are upside down, they are not on the same line, not aligned.

Zero is often left out. Laegna number system turns all the numbers under zero upside down:
* In Little-endian numbers of Laegna, -1 is -1 as in decimal system.
* In Big-endian numbers of Laegna, -1 is upside down: it's more like equal to 0 as the next number is +1, but it's body is still downwards, so as a whole number, it basically fits the same are with -1. We can see that as the whole numbers, numbers have bodies - 3, for example, is 3 times bigger than 1 and consists of 1, 2, 3. They point upwards, so their exact values compared to their values as whole numbers are of length 0, but when they are considered wholes, the length is 1.

Where is 0 located? It's between two numbers, which have their bodies connected. Then, -1 has it's body connected to 1 and thus, 1 logically comes right after -1. But there is another number between - and as -1 and 1 touch each others, number 0 must be of different length, it must be zero-length number where other numbers have length 1. If it would have length 1, we would have 1.5 instead of 1 as value of +1, and -1.5 instead of -1 as value of -1.

Zero is very important in Laegna and it's covered by multitude of meanings in "U". In a version of whole numbers, for example, "U" is added to the middle to denote odd number axe, whereas the normal axe without "U" is even - for example, when 0 is a center of pixelated image with even number of pixels, "U" must be used to denote this number as a whole number. There are other cases of using "U", but they are always logical, where the decimal system fails. Laegna system must reach infinity and to do this, it must do it very precisely - decimal system has lost something in infinity; when it cannot, by all means and relations, go straight to Zero, but becomes distorted by several means, provising us with paradoxes, it would leave even more paradoxes to the point in infinity from limit of the number system; this point is kind of not a number. I imagine that counting 0, 1, 2, etc. we wont reach infinity properly, but fail in several ways with it's symmetry. So, in number 2, which contains two whole numbers, where -1 and 1 are kind of directly connected (especially in big-endian) I see the space for games, which resolve the symmetries of infinity and consistency of the number system expressible. Laegna, unlike the Latin system, is then very verbose about the paradoxes, making them very visible in the fact that the number system itself does not provide us with imaginary symmetry without an expression, but the proper ways to approach, at the same time, all the funny relations in written-out form. Thus, having a special number would benefit us often! But we can see that the system of 4 cannot always be used to have centers - even 1, when in some cases it works like 5 as a center, could also be seen differently; this happens in symmetries of Laegna to be reached later.
