### Documentation for Using `llm-smoll` with Python

#### **Install Tools**
To use `llm-smoll`, you need to install the base `llm` library first. This library provides the framework for interacting with language models locally. Once installed, you can add the `llm-smoll` plugin, which bundles the SmolLM2 model directly into your Python environment.

---

#### **Download Models**
The `llm-smoll` plugin includes a quantized version of the SmolLM2 model. When you install the plugin, the model is automatically downloaded and stored locally. This eliminates the need for external repositories or gated access. The model is lightweight, making it suitable for systems with limited resources.

#### **Fine-Tune**
Fine-tuning `llm-smoll` involves:
1. Preparing a dataset in a structured format, such as JSONL, containing instructions, inputs, and expected outputs.
2. Configuring training parameters, including batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
3. Running the fine-tuning process using the `llm` CLI or Python API. The plugin supports efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA for adapting the model to specific tasks.

---

#### **Export to GGUF**
After fine-tuning, you can export the model to GGUF format for optimized inference. This process includes:
1. Quantizing the fine-tuned model to reduce its size and improve efficiency.
2. Saving the model in GGUF format, which is compatible with tools like `llama.cpp`.
3. Optionally sharing the GGUF model for deployment or further use.
