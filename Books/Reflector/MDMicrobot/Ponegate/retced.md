# Logecs

__Logecs__ is the new logic we use: based on Halting Problem and Russell's paradoxes, including the paradox of uniting math and logic, we disprove binary system by it's assumption of _completeness_, whereas Laegna system is incomplete.

# _Basic Ten and Den_, __Tenden__:

_Basic Ten and Den_ (of base-4 and base-2): @_Basic Ten and Den_ (of base-IE and base OA)_

__Ten__: _`Ten["I", "O", "A", "E"]`_ are _digits_.

__Den__: _`Den["O", "A"]`_ is equal to _`Bool["False", "True"]`_, but not identical.

# _Low-frequency Ten_, __Polar Ten__:

_R and T of Lower Ten_, __Lower Ten__: Take __Ten__[...], with i being digit index;
* __Ten.R__: `R = i % 2 (rows)`
* __Ten.R__: `T = int(i / 2)`
* __Ten.R!=Ten.T__: `R != T` => the value is _illusory_ or _projective_
* __Ten.R!=Ten.T__: `R=T` => the value is real.

_Ponegative of Lower Ten_, __Lower Ten__: Based on R=T, binary logic doubles:
* __Negotion__: `I` is real negative
* __Negation__: `O` is illusory negative
* __Position__: `A` is real positive
* __Posetion__: `E` is illusory positive.

_Dene of Lower Ten_, __Polar Ponegation__: In `Dene[["O", "A"], ["A", "O"]]`, Complex Ten of Two Dimensions, the `Polar` `Logecs` `Ponegation` appears: outer values, which meet at "__Circular Infinity__", fail, and the inner values at "__Anticircular Zero__" do succeed.

_Signed Mathematecal Ten_, __Signed Ten__: `SignedTen[-2, -1, 1, 2]`.

_Unsigned Mathematecal Ten_, __Unsigned Ten__: `UnSignedTen[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

_Mathematecs maps Logecs_, __Mathélogecs__: Signed Ten and Unsigned Ten map the _Mathematecs_ perfectly to Logecs, becoming the digits

_Law of Polarity_, __Frequential Numbers__: the Lower Frequency is equal, but smaller than Higher Frequency.

_Law of anti-Polarity_, __Laegna Binary Numbers__: we have to _unline_ or create a `Complex` to have the minus axe negative.

_Posetive Zone_, __Higher Harmonics__: `Ó` and `Á` are added at the end to create `Position`.

__Real and Imaginary__: `R=T` is the real, and `R!=T` is the imaginary axe and forms complexes (I call the case of opposition of minus axe a "__Complex__").

_High-frequency Ten_, __Linear Ten__: `R = int(i / 2)` and `T = i % 2`.

_Higher Frequency `R`_, __Higher `R`__: is directly the `Truth Value` - when a system is _raising_, it maps itself to these coordinates, and the `Linear Ten` unless we are using _Flat Coordinate System_, appears upside (at `AE-position`).

_Lower Frequency Ten_, __Lower Ten__:
* __Negotion `I`__: `I` is `Negotion`
* __Posetion `O`__: `O` is `Posetion`
* __Negation `A`__: `A` is `Negation`
* __Position `E`__: `E` is `Position`.

__Position `E`__: `E` is `Position`, where the actual outcomes are better, than the failures, which do not matter.

__Posetion `O`__: when `O` is `Posetion`, the bad values are above zero, but good illusions are better than bad reality.

_Order of Lower Frequency Ten_, __Lower Ten__: _Linearly_, each next value is better than value before, and the Center is in Between.
