# Notice

This seems to be a simplistic implementation, but if you want:
- Copy the py and html files into your directory.
- Copy the py files from parent directory of this.
- Run them with "flask run" in the same folder.

If CoPilot made any errors, fix them:
- Task given to it is quite complete and I rather want to contain the first answers right now, and not to test them immediately as they are close enough to give the idea with normal speed of writing text; I will use them for my own implementation, where the architecture, imports and hooks are perfect thing to use - for example, you don't have to seach libraries and implementation details, which are lost in more complex implementations you can do even by smarter AI, by trying to run the code and giving it feedback: you will be in complete control of code, which is meant in _these parts where I keep the model code, which is a little like pseudocode_.
