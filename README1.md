# Independent contributors

Our effort is to contribute to the scientific work and to involve you, as I am physically limited and cannot, for example, create all the examples for Laegna Framework of Thought, Programming and AI intelligence:
- Go to our developer page at (/Books/DevBooks/)[this GitHub source folders] and use the given manual as _user_, _administrator_ or _developer_ or as an _independent contributor_:
  - __User__: download a Bot Framework, such as Jan, GPT4All or LM Studio, with Jan being a good end-user software for basic chat, GPT4All being a manager of your documentation or book and your assistant in giving explanations, and LM Studio a powerful tool for AI Service and Administration.
  - __Administrator__: basically, even if you can't code, you need all developer service. For example, you use VSCode to administer configuration files and to have access to GitHub.
  - __Developer__: instructions are given. Start Assisted Coding and forget about plain-text files.

## Independent Scientific Work

Once you are a _Scientist_ or _Enlightened Person_ with contributions, you can:

_Phase 1_:
- Collect your books, papers and notes to folders, where you have:
  - A microbot version, where intro to all your theory is contained in a few, structured pages and any of the paragraphs does not need much contextual attention to participiate in discussion, where the bot might find relevant sources but not have much attention.
  - Several folders with many files of yours, which take a while to _index_ and _embed_.
  - Collect, into folders, your books, papers, documents, notes and university work, where are your references and basis. Also create one folder with a very basic, balanced set, which gives a bot some background to discuss it generally, and more specific folders, which take longer to index (embed and reference).

_Phase 2_:
- Option 1:
  - Install GPT4All or other _context aware bot_. Add your documentation folders, separately and with proper names, to LocalDocs document collection system.
  - Load appropriate model, and mark the LocalDocs collections it needs to use.
  - Start chatting about your scientific work.
  - Your mission is to find selection of documents and sources, which make it a proficient bot.
    - You might have too few of them, so that the bot is not informed.
    - You might have too many, so it starts to have attention problems and does not find your more important sources and ideas, forgetting them selectively.
    - In each case, you refine your selections.
- Option 2:
  - Install VSCode or IDE for programmers.
  - Notice that in addition to code files, you can have your work in MD files, where it's a _structured Markdown editor_ for _general knowledge base creation_; now it's not only to programmers, but to informed users, who want to back up their information base. Having Workspaces and Projects under them is convenient - install Markdown plugins, some for HTML etc. While VSCode does not trivially open them (without some work), you can put PDF, HTML, Javascript and CSS files into subfolders to be used by your project.
  - Point GPT4All to your source folders if you have it.
  - VSCode is also a back-up system able to keep history of your documents, you achieve this with "Source Control", which is now rather "Documentation Control".
  - You can install mathematical systems, such as Prolog and Julia. While at their whole capabilities, they are complex and difficult programming languages: in your case, you write simple expressions like "12 * 4" or add your shopping items with prices (ask GPT), and it gives you the answer or total price for example. In old times, scientists always ran with their little code snippets programmed by somebody forgot, lost time ago.
  - You can install Cascade, TabNine, CoPilot and other AI engines: you select not "Instruct", but something like a general philosopher or scientist as your model (model consists of _brain_ and _memory_, while you add _knowledge base_, _personality and character_ to get a _bot_ or an _AI teacher_).

_Phase 3_:
- You can create Q&A cards and generators
- You can use Notion.so or my system or anything else to put them into web in proper AI format
- People can use your docs in knowledge base of their bots

_Phase 4_:

Fine-tuning:
- You create Q&A cards and add your docs
- You use Developer's book to fine-tune your bot: this is specific training of your docs, where an AI is using it's intelligent capabilities and being creative, not using your papers based on it's current knowledge, with help of rather "unconscious" indexer, not it's own system.
- Knowing some about how AI's work, I would tell you to keep your model _sustainable_: add it's existing training materials and the system, which fed them when they were trained, and randomly mix your own training cards with it's initial input, including how it was learning to calculate etc.
  - This happens, because while the AI won't forget, it creates complex logic if the _new_ input needs to be connected: things, which are trained in mixed order, get more probable intelligent connections.
- Structure your work into meaningful wholes: you can spend some time giving entries of related topics; where it has optimized related logic in mixed order, but having related things close, it will create meaningful connections faster.

## Collaborating with me within your scientific work

- With my major theorems, such as 1 introductionary and 5 infinity theorems, explain your theory and it's implications; try to reach it's actual information, with it's own terms, from my Axiomatic system, in it's own terms.
- Write down, how your theory supports or criticizes one or another aspect of my theory.
- Do your calculations with Laegna numbers, in simplified form; try to involve community-social and ethical or spiritual aspects into your axiomatic or tautological model, with help of my theories.
- Create generators, if you know about programming, which resolve tasks in your theory, with randomly generated inputs and output formats/wordings.

> Create your copy of Laegna Math Framework, add your content as a book and serve at your GitHub, or commit a book into my system.

> Connect your pages and math or other generators to pages of mine, so that a Spider can generally fine-tune both sources at the same time, whoever creates the generator.

As I develop my website structure: you can use the framework to introduce and organize your science and feed it with generated tasks to a Deep Learning model. Over time, I will create code, implementations, ideas and architectures for related solutions and we can use what I have made and implement what I and others have proposed. When you develop your site based on my framework, you can purify and contribute back in neutral format compatible with work of others - for example, if you have a nice menu. You can create a project of my framework, which is separate from Laegna, but has it as optional library, and create a library set based on user's books, theories and contributions, where one can download different Laegna Implementations as modules of a system. My site will be always Laegna-specific, while it's possible to create more general approaches to my specific implementations, and also systems and frameworks, which see Laegna Math Framework and Website as a special case, not general rule or implementation, and is able to take it philosophically, doubting aspects of implementation and design specifically. This kind of generalization is also idea here, where I try to generalize any particular part of theory or site functionality, in docs, into more general theory it's based on.
