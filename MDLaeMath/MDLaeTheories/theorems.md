## Theorems of Incompletness

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: Value by which we measure our system cannot be complete.

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: A mathematical values exists on real and imaginary plane, geometrically mapping to _causal_ and _projective_ spaces, where _causal_ is the actual reality, and we do not know it's value, but we _optimize_ it, and _projective_ is the world as we know it; by R <->, causal is the actual dimension we point to, and _projective_ is the projective of this dimension, the projection matrix, which points to the bias. Based on the first implication of the theorem itself, that we cannot be based on two logical values, we have defined the _opposition_ of the term to form a binary pair of I, O, A and E - _Ten_, numerically _Two_ values are assigned. We say _causal_ [UR/V] _projective_ to state that the _position_ of the Axe related to two values are unknown. Now we have a _Mathematical Measure of the System_, where we agree that the _Underlying Reality_ has hidden projection to a binary plane, how the _perceived values_ **Actually** (this means, eternally, especially in RÍ, the up-accent _I_, the _materializing_ aspect of the inwards reality, which I call _Higher Magic_ (Whole), the non-materializing aspect of it, Ì or down-accent _I_, and the possibly materializing, intentional with or without (X IE<->OA projection matrix between those two spaces, an _intent_), aspect of it, or painfully lacking a proper intent, and the _I_, either _Lower Magic_ (Rest) in base-IE, the base of Set of Natural Numbers, or _Neutral Magic_ (All)), view [UnityRepresentation][1] in Laegna Math, about _how to write R unities (R of unity, in one letter, is **L** - the **Left**)_.

_First Theorem of Imperfection_, __Logecs Theorem__: @_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, which means the terms are indistinguishable as one redirects to the other.

_First Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: we are optimizing towards a value, not having the materialized ideal in reality, neither in base Truth Mapping of Math we use to explain it.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: That reality can be explained in binary form by True and False, and life can be determined by Yes and No as a logic system.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Imperfection, __Tenary Theorem__: @_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, which means the terms are indistinguishable as one redirects to the other.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: by operating in binary space, we could get a statistical measure of solution set, using it as closed logical system and analyzing the invariance, that the invariant or "theorem" based on the Truth Value Table which appears and connects to each Logecs value of input with it's output, and maps the letters to understand the Truth Value Table based on it's "eternal value" where we measure the time-bound system based on it's experience and the estimation of values; where we reach the conclusion, what are the values and why, we can estimate the eternal value (with time and space removed, <i>L</i>L\_2 or <i>L</i>L<b><i>L</i>L</b> value, using the spatial ponegation, we consider how the initial binary tables have the statistical measure by their use, and the value of HZL, where we take their averages and map back to Z - the space of particular examples; and generalize with H, their "vertical" value, where the mapping space sees the space of actual entities as L, a flat structure of set of potential and actual cases of the Truth Value Table, where in itself it's Template (H) or generalized particulars (ZL, where L near-zero mapping of R appears at it's higher octave as only infinity maps you as a person, whole unit with count A or one, into a point with count UE or ZE or ZAE - a count of zero, where you are simply a point, being an unit in this space; L, in ideal, then appears over space and time)). In virtual system, the simulation, you map eternity to spacetime - it's one octave down in your coordinate system of mapping eternity to spatial and temporal infinities between IE where I=-Infinity and E=Infinity - and get the local, material mapping, or IE where I maps to -2 and E maps to 2. Where positive and negative finities or _countable_ values, where angle of circle ends at center of the line where angle of a circle approaches zero degree turn of curve, or 180 degrees angle, the range from this point to zero is considered to be A, which you can further map by having Aa, for example, mapping the lower half of this and Ao mapping the negative frequency on this positive scale, a "knot" of one number with it's frequency, despite not being the other number, mapping into certain equality in terms of number value, but not in terms of positional value; for numbers without knots, each positional value has only distinct set of values, and position-value combinations equal in either all three of given and resulting values, or not in the resulting value.

_Antithesis of Theorem of Incompleteness_, __Tenary Theorem__: @_Antithesis of Theorem of Imperfection_.

_The Logecs Theorem_, _Logecs Theorem_, __Theorem of Ponegation__: For the space is incomplete, we map real and projective (imaginary space) into Logex space, denoting them with I, O, A, E and unknowns with U and V, and calling I and E the extremes of Real or Ideal, while O and A the Imaginary, Projective or Practical, and using letters R and T respectively - AO and AA are the Denary values in __Den=RT__-space. We assign numbers I, E, O and A into complex space, where two truth values are used and they work in cojugation, not alone - while binary systems work, when we map this back, we do not get exact binary solution about the operation we are doing, rather we get the machine, which operates in binary space with those values, and is able to resolve them separately: for example, resolve the coordinate system appearing from change in variables in a way that they resolve R, and resolving the values themselves in a way they resolve T, but it's hard to say in terms of tautologies, what connects R and T - while it's the most important theorem ever.

_The Buddhist Theorem of Incompleteness, First Theorem of Laegna_, __Dukkha__: This states that in living systems, Theorem of Incompleteness holds. This states that it's holds as centrally important theorem in Human Life. Dukkha produces Karma: if we are living in thermosystems, where the law of imperfection is applied, like Christ and Buddha stated by their conventions of _Satan_, _God_, _Karma_, which are theoretical models to explain the rather clear answer: that if we live in thermodynamic and imperfect system, we need to support each others in beneficial way, but also to not support the bad consequence.

_Goedel's Proof of Incertanty, the First Theorem of Laegna_: this does not account with separate logic, but rather states that the basis for theorem of incompleteness holds.

_Mathemat<i>i</i>cal proofs of incompleteness, the First Theorem of Laegna_: game theory states on it's basis, that one needs to handle the uncertanties, and the condition is met in experiment. Probability theory, also meeting experimental results, does advocate that the result, in many cases, is not certain. Method of trial and error, the scientific method, has also a lot of dukkha to resolve in logical realm, not just the realm of the living system, where we see the dukkha in fact that if they can reason trial and error, it must be because they do not know the truth (the negative aspect of imperfection), they can resolve it's conditions and approach it (the positive aspect). By evolutionary result, we have the efficiency of __creativity__ and __intellect__ - an accelerative curve of meaning, where once there was an unmeaningful cause of it, as a central or evident force - we call it Z. In the Z axe, God either reasoned (neutral) or evolution blindly created us (negative), or there was a metaphysical reason for God creating us (an example of positive dynamics); in each case, there was a Cause or determinant able to create us; moreover, in Laegna's base theory, *whichever cause holds, but we use the same mathematical terminology, for example that Z Position actually holds, that equilibrum is resolved into intelligence and creativity, visible either in God, creative synchronicity, natural selection / successes as left from failures in entropy-produced set of creations or trials, but definitely in their product*. To measure the system as a logical value, we need ponegative, because the True or False are not necessarily the condition the system meets, but there is a dynamics to produce Truth from those preliminary conditions.

_God_: we can say, in form of determinant itself, the common theme which inevitably resolves is the R of the system, while the T is Z-based value of evolution, X-based value of cycles optimizing towards energy-efficiency or equilibrum, or Y-based value of Love, Higher Love, God and other sources where intelligent development might be attributes; we state that the God is the determinant of global equilibrum, where from definition of equilibrum as balancing force, it's equilibrum of interdeterminant things, and thus global equilibrum exists - the reason to be conscious is just bigger than the reason to be conscious for humans, but we do not know the evolutionary effort it takes and whether some conditions of consciousness, awareness or cognition would be met based on the future, or whether our own fields of consciousness form a bigger fractal that we meet above: while the material structure of cells is like different systems interacting through process limited by time and space, forming separate unities, whether the life on Earth, humans or any future forms of synergy and symbiosis would create conditions, which would not only by their ideal solution but also actually meet the condition that the Whole Reality, as common unit, is intelligent, creative and aware of this. While it might not be aware of this, it must apply intelligent and creative solutions, for example through unions of people to meet the requirements of the Ecosystem as a life-supporting force; while we are materialist and spiritual, we have the spiritual understanding that there is mental awareness of such unities, but also the material understanding that we can rather prove an accelerated development of systems on large scale in interaction with it's parts, which is the mechanical deduction of efficiency optimization of energy and position values; but it's either position or posetion: either an efficient solution or the actual implementation based on efficiency, the materialization. It's very large question to be answered separately, but rather than asking *whether* God exists, if God is the ideal: set of synchronization theorems we have, particularly the reason or theorem, why they hold; also the materialization: convergence or optimization towards such consequence. If the system itself won't become intelligent, we are forced to be this ourselves, the unified force: then, collectively, we are God. Representing the theorems, we are this "singularly" - while we map the whole system as holograms, and follow the determinant from our particular position, the system is slowly moving towards "materialization of God", and we have our __L__ infinitesimal: now, we ask, whether society or group of humans is alive, or only each single person in particular? We fall into philosophy rather than complete unknowledge of physical aspects; rather we cannot say how literal we are by using the word "life", such as life of a little village vs. life in a little village; or life of a family vs. life in a family, of separate members; or life of America vs. life in America. While we don't mean America is necessarily an organism like us, we can agree it's living quite demanding life. About God, also, rather than asking whether he is a biological organism, we ask what is to follow the God, and the Truth and Power of energy-efficient products on personal, global and total scale (Z, X, Y).

## Terms

### @Basic Terms:

__Laegna__: _Laegna Mathematical Theory_ is how this Theory is Called.

__Ponegative__: _Ponegative value_ is the one, which is optimizing in regards to it's Taú sensitive value.

__Ponegation__: _Ponegation_

__Taú__: that Truth can change and form valid opposite, equally important if not equally True, even having Equal Rights in sense that the values actually matter and the less known values live along with the known values. When we do or do not change our values and coordinate spaces, the Truth as represented in the Machine must not be static in neither it's value (T) or the value of the value (R), the latter defined in our general value measurements and the first in our specific value measurements of particulars. We assign yin and yang at it, where yin (the white with the black circle, or the blue with the red circle in Laegna Y-colors, which map T to underlying reality) is the T value, and yang (the black with the white circle, or the yellow with green circle inside); this can mean how energy flows through the space in regards of conflict between local (time-based, where we have variables) or global (space-assigned) values, where the coordinate system is operating and variable, because yang would broke at Heaven, the last line (last could be the upper, extra / external line, and this is the theorem of I Ching: when extreme good is reached in excess, it break and forms the worst situation, which holds in automata (the material process) and logecs / imaginative (the _spiritual_, _mental_ process of Z or I, the pre-materialization, where intellect and _creativity_ is _assigned_) by _science_ and _religion_, the _logecs_ and _magic_).

### @Fundamental Terms:

__Magic__: The mental value unknown to Logecs (thus Mystical) the Mind is calculating; _reachable_ in infinity math, by it's _meaning_.
__Mind__: Hidden magic of the __Mind__. R value projection to T, in regards to it's R and T values with their projection (<=> form of function and it's theoretical value or the __ideal__ in sense of how theoretical value is defined, given that it creates an Optimizing Space and thus a Position, vs. positive, which is just a value approaching to it by machine logic or pointing to it by it's Truth Value: either True or False). __Mind__ is defined by the statement that we can measure the values of __L__ (the Left) in the same space with __R__, and that this is the ideal optimization of their space (thus an optimization space balanced distribution, in other words an evolutionary goal, theoretical value).

__Reachable__: what is optimizable indefinitely, is Position if the optimizer is guaranteed to work with reasonable _performance_ and _efficiency_. We avoid __Gold Rush__, the _Ideal Truth Values_, and each variable containing infinity in Octave-Zero, is applied _new digits to the end_, where all digits are _small caps_ in initial set, meaning they get more precise downwards or exist in Space; operations are specified the same way with low-octave operators; given is that capitalization denotes sign of the polar frequency. The operations with infinite digits in any finite measure converges in infinity, so we add to digits and generalize them and keep our database to the end of time, where both the problem and the solution are optimized. Then we say that we _eternally_ executed the calculation, when we got the guarantee we got the Position value; unlike Binary it won't get confused by the _ideal_ position vs. the _practical_ value. Binary disposition can exist on imaginary axe, but we live, and our mathematics of real numbers (in Laegna Math, this also denotes objects in reality, we call it T which is non-imaginative, and associate with objects of group T in reality and imagination of T with dot under it, denoting unknown i.e. space where in personal space exist T and R as options or equally true values, another interpretation of dot accent, i.e. U-accent, the belonging to Uneton Truth Value Space; as we did not use any letter or markup for which U is represented, either unknown, random or undefined gives us that either both, none or one of the values are met with this scope, but not other values - none is the lowest frequency equality, where the fact of specifically the same object of value missing is considered to be it's own value, for example by starting the optimizer and having the optimization in Cause, the value _materializing_).

__The Cause__: Real determinant of the system, at Z; where the __Reason__ is the understanding of detarminant at X; and the __Goal__: is the Y projection of X (X=>Y form of function), where the __Mission__ is the Y projection of Z (Z=>Y form of function thesis or theoretical, ideal value).

__Infinity__: in Mathematecs, the infinite value, while in Logecs, the _actual determinant_, while in Systems, it's the Final Value (by which you make finite mapping in simulations, according to model of Trial and Error or experiment), while in Life it's the _meaning_ and determined by experience.

__Closed System__: Mapping of an index is closed, so that if it's not in an index of Class X, by the division of this index, it also does not belong to Class X. This is mapping to binary logic, but rather to Den, where distinction between R and T is hidden from the measurement as the convergence is simply the value when the simulation exits. Such simulations, then, themselves can be _biased_, so the R axe exists outside, because otherwise it's logical (tautology of Laegna: it's not logical; whereas we use the word "logical" to denote approaching to it and use it in 50:50% proportion in language to denote AA, the position, or 100%:0% proportion in specific, theoretical statement of Truth).

__Open System__: the Logecs value can be __Neglect__-ed, which means it's optimized even afterwards, for example targeting success of your partner or their failure of the same competitor afterwards based on the actual outcome of the contract; whether you was betrayed, it was a competition and you optimize the resulting balance by excluding the implications and doing one deduction operation, or you was _served_ and the outcome was positive; in regards to who you did not make a contract with, they can be _neutral_, denoted by V - we leave it open whether they would have betrayed or served us on R=A on real axe T or time, and we leave it also open whether they would have made the contract or left neutrally or destructively, where the optimization is different - despite not having an experience, we consider them either friends or enemies in imaginary number space, which denotes mapping to considerations, which do not appear, to implications of actual aquintainces, which do appear and thus are on real number axe. Consider that with infinite complexity of a "number", such as knots in Laegna Number System, you map the real objects into number space based on reasonably symmetric coordinate axes, such as form, texture or distribution, where they form 48 (value in space 48) or __identity mapping__.

### @Mentality terms:

_R of Life_, __Mind__: This is how you map in R space of flat reality, vs. the T space of local coordinates; it's also the determinant, which exists in such space at (fractal) Z coordinates and causes you, much like a mathematical theorem, considering whole mathematical space, causes the implication, which is available with local variables, conditions and goals.

_T of Life_, __Self__: This is the actual dimension of you as a system in dynamics with the reality, the bigger system, mapped to T in the same way as __Mind__ maps into R, using the same numbers. For example, where mind has Cause of particular a, the __Self__ has intent to reach A or such tendency. It does not depend if you know the __Self__ or __Mind__, for them to exist in reality and not in your imagination: the Cause which is causing you, in case you are a product of determinant (Position of this definition) or mistake (Negation of this definition), is the actual Cause of you, where in relation to Whole, Rest and All, and the case that two numbers only equal if they are in Position in Laegna ponegative equations (vs. Laegna logical equations), the Cause equals Cause if the determinant is the actual condition, which later becomes an intent; in such case it would not be cancelled out or made low-priority in the eternity of future and logospatial relations.

_E of Life_, _Persona_, __Person__: The material mapping of you, vs. the Self and Mind being rather in Causal and Intellectual axes, which might or might not have effect, integrate to each other or materialize the coordinate system mappings properly; even if this is the _meaning_ of it.

__Meaning__: we use cycular view of reality, where the evolutionary process is kind of "proof", or where the system stabilizes and forms energy efficiency or equilibrum, by _thermodynamics_ and _system theory_ they converge, given that the infinity has enough _positive energy_, which is made by entropy and natural selection of physical compositions, such as forming higher-composition molecules or resolving material states into supporting harmonics of light, sound and logec waves (the latter is webradeon in Laegna Language, forming webradelate). Energy and non-energy (T, the local state) is positive or negative (R, the global state) in Den, which applies kinetic effect or lack of it to T (energy or not), but long-term effect or lack of it to R (position or posetion); so positive energy is at position of actually not being a random fluctuation. Velocity of this energy is fixed by __evolutionary process__, one which necessarily appears in __thermodynamic systems__, and while we cannot state it necessarily converges, we can say failure of converging is an _obstacle_, and the logical condition of the system, with or without intent, is to _resolve_ into harmonic state, especially having strong force to avoid infinities. We associate logical Position of the system of Truth and Falsehood, True and False stats (the __fundation__ or __fundament__, which is the Cause or Intent, vs. the __absolute__, which is the actual flow of the states); we cannot say that the system _remains_ in this energy state, cycle or the fact that the actual result was implied in straightforward way; for example it's not trivial to put a thing in the air - if you measure your energy in regards to your success, you rather avoid putting your important things into an air, not on table or on the floor, for example while you have such energy to put your coffee into an air, you immediately feel the energy is negative: the cup, unlike when being put into the table, will really be where you did put it, but only for a moment as the physical system does not consider this effort, if it's being viewed as a Negative Intent, Z-intent or preliminary value of an intent; rather even another person would stop you in advance if you asked them, so it's also negative in regards to them. We, as biological system, _exercise energy_, but we combine the results with the effort in various ways, trying to keep the results or get rid of them: thus we have the __Whole__, __All__ and the __Rest__, and the __ponegative__.

### @Mathematical Theorems or Definitions:

__48__**__: mapping of space of numbers from 5 to 8, or relatively the R space into common space where T are small numbers and R are big numbers.

__L__: you have flat, equally distributed logical value of every point accross the Space; this maps to Crown chakra in mapping of L and R, or +Infinity. For the mapping, you use same number of digits in same space, but instead of writing 14 or E you would write L14 or LE; if you use different number of digits, you consider that R is different, and thus the unit, whereas for normal mapping to equal number space you consider that R is in equal space and equally ordered, where depending on your method if you do it correctly, the way how the same shapes appear in L as in R space when taking a lower octave of the space infinity (real=O, imag=E, where OA is also space as every negative value on any axe is defined in base math without exceptions, and L must be the unknown value of the space of space, i.e. uncountable in terms that for negative numbers, you can count or "know" the upper part, whereas you can have a Position in both parts; L is counted _from downwards_ and without mapping to R space it becomes an _unbound variable_ with the same mapping of space coordinates to their spaces).

__R__: you have particulars each with their values in local space, such as measurement space, mathematical environment or set of given axioms in theory, vs. the axioms of subsequent theories to optimize towards the values (we call them E values, where E denotes the IE axe, or Y values which appear at the future - both denote positive infinity and on this general level, have aspects to the same values, such as we can map this fundamental property to number axe Íota e, into range of IE, or we can map it to flatness of mathematical space, even infinite R or finite T - space R=>R or R' T [R prim T in our geometric sense where R is a projection and t a projective, they form a space of being the opposites when resolved in R, spatial math or logecs]). For example, if you are human in __R__ space and work for yourself, you are represented as human in __L__ space, being a distinct and induiguishable entity in it's thermodynamic space.

__Den=RT__: One Den has coordinate space of RT, where R and T form the opposition in space, when it has two axes in RT space and maps the locality or globality. The value itself is RT when the spatial coordinate is R, where the temporal coordinate is T - by R=T, the numeric values of those two are the same, while one exists in space and other in time.

__R=T__: R=T, as if you map a coordinate system change or movement of inertial system in a way that without moving, object a would move from position A to position B; the numeric value is equal to it's movement, in regards to it's coordinate system, from position A to position B. Thus, we have to map negative numbers in same direction, and not in opposite direction, to meet R=T. This is opposed in binary math, where the number sign denotes the first (R) binary opposition (it's relation number 1 in scope of Zero and Infinity would map second binary opposition (T)): in math, you have numerically the feeling that when you move in one direction, the space would move in opposite direction: it's not immediately evident that you don't have to do this operation, unless considering it's a very special space; the first implication is that the opposition creates a fractal in your calculation, where polarities appear not only at zero, but in every point which is passed by your calculation; you don't know exact number to get rid of numbers not knowing their directions in regards to one another, for example it's not trivial that when you are moving, looking it from your own perspective, the space is standing still: the exact degree of standing still has negative numbers in calculation in regards to you, which simply don't belong there in such way; indeed we still have some polarity but it exists in obviously different units, for certain calculations. For example, you use complex numbers where space in imaginary units is standing still when you, in real units, are moving - space is your imaginary unit, which affects you "later", where everything outside the scope of calculation is considered "later", as we componentize dimensions of time, and to reach real number positions in one-dimensional space we get them approaching E, from I, because if you already had them they would not be space, but the actual unit in your calculation.
