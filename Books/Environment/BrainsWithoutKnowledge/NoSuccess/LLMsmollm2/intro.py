# llm_smoll_workflow.py

# Step 1: Install required packages
# Uncomment the lines below and run them in your terminal to install the packages.
# pip install llm  # Install the base llm library
# pip install llm-smoll  # Install the llm-smoll plugin with the SmolLM2 model
# pip install transformers datasets  # Optional: Install additional packages for advanced fine-tuning
# pip install trl torch accelerate  # Optional: Install fine-tuning libraries if required

# Step 2: Import required libraries
import llm

# Step 3: Initialize the llm-smoll model
# Ensure the plugin is installed and the model is available.
smoll_model = llm.get_model("SmolLM2")

# Step 4: Prepare a dataset for fine-tuning
# Structure your dataset as a list of dictionaries with keys like "instruction", "input", and "output".
dataset = [
    {"instruction": "Summarize this text", "input": "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.", "output": "A fox jumped over a dog."},
    {"instruction": "Generate a greeting", "input": "Formal", "output": "Good evening, how may I assist you?"},
]

# Step 5: Fine-tune the model
# Use the llm library's fine-tuning functionality to adapt the model to your dataset.
smoll_model.fine_tune(dataset)

# Step 6: Export the model to GGUF format
# Save the fine-tuned model in GGUF format, optimized for llama.cpp compatibility.
export_path = "fine_tuned_smoll_model.gguf"
smoll_model.export_to_gguf(export_path)

# Final Step: Confirm completion
print(f"Fine-tuned model exported successfully to {export_path}.")
