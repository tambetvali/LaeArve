# Reflector and the Books

The Lmw (Laegna Math Website) reflects on it's source tree,
and generates the site including: Folder Books, which contain
the documentations with generators of Q&A items, and inside it,
folder Reflector, which includes the whole source code from Root
Folder to behave like public documentation.

On site, Books is the main content and Root of the site, whereas
the Root is added as a book named "Reflector".
