# Laegna Design

! For each chapter below, I give each part of chapter tree to the top each comment.

Style of Laegna website:
- Theme: cientific, religious; materialist, spiritual; also philosophical.
- Attribute: It's a minimalist style with light, but kind of intense colors.
- Font set is mixing the medievial style (religious), minding gothic letters, with philosophical and scientific style, correct fonts such as verdana and simplistic style.
- Color theme: Black represents the local unknown (whether you get food tonight), white represents the absolute unknown (whether there is God and Mind), Red represents the local bad (does not get hamburger) and green the local good (you arrive 10 minutes earlier, but others are already there); blue the global good (corporation, heaven, digital math) and yellow the global bad (third world country, hell, mathematical mistakes or not having philosophy).

Style sheet rather relies on classes than id's to keep it html-ish and self-explanatory *open source*, which means we use emphasis not bold for dictionary terms, quote not div for a bullet box etc, and style sheet creates the appearance. We do not use other terms only for some visual effect. This means: except for About and Main Menu at topleft, which are dynamic, there are no positioning (such as absolute or float) and no special effects; while paddings, margins, etc. _which are typical layout options and available for long_ can be used; it's modern HTML, but follows certain aspects of old-school HTML, where there is big difference in philosophy, whether you are doing layout for a page, or you are doing a dynamic, interactive vector-drawing like environment; we, in this case, want to be kind of *official*, *scientific* and *representative*. I am not very literal, but I do have a deep meaning: it's very informative page, not to be cluttered by bells and whistles; same time we use utf-8 icons, colors, positioning in tables etc. I would call this "standard HTML".

> CSS is based mostly on _classes_ and _element types_; it's not based on _id_'s or custom, non-standard identifiers. Each section (as given in list below) has their own class, but otherwise we use the HTML tag names: for example, as we have only one type of bullets, we can use "quote" container, which looks similar.

In this document, we have the following sections:
- Main page; "laeMain" class
- Top bar; "laeHeader" class
- Left pane; "laeMenu" class
- Content pane; "laePage" class
- - Main page header; "laeTitlePage" class
- - Content index; laeContentIndex class
- - Actual content; "laePage" class
- Footer; "laeFooter" class
- Study Cards (also have their own class); "laeCard" class

For each section, we create a Flask template and separate CSS file. Additionally, we create the HTML container, which has HTML, HEAD and BODY blocks. Each Flask template has: 

### AI preprocessing task

Given the information in this file; with my chat input linking to this file and containing it's content until this block: the task of an AI is to analyze this document and, not repeating it's content unless summarizing or emphasising, to complete the task with:
- A generic standard information, where each section will be generated separately, but they might need general common information, like precise style description, or standards like colors might repeat and make contrasts or harmonies or important disharmonics, font selections must follow a given style and for example left and right panes must align, despite also forming a necessary contrast of menu being rather intuitive and designed, while toolbox is rather strict and resembles a tool.
- To finish the task, filling the gaps and creating a coherent style.
- Notice that colors and many other settings chosen by me are often symbolic to me, I am very serious about my style and this is not to criticize it; rather to complete it.
- I copy-paste yours under this section, so start with fourth-level header such as "####" and you can use headers below, such as "#####"!

I get only lists of points.

#### An answer from Cascade

Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and information about the design of the website. Here is a summary of the main points:

1. The theme of the website is scientific, religious, materialist, spiritual, philosophical, and it follows a minimalist style with light colors.
2. The font set consists of Gothic letters, correct fonts such as Verdana, and simplified styles.
3. The color theme includes black (local unknown), white (absolute unknown), red (local bad), green (local good), blue (global good), and yellow (global bad).
4. The style sheet relies on classes and element types to create the appearance, with a focus on using standard HTML tags.
5. The website has four main sections: Main page, Top bar, Left pane, Content pane, Footer, and Study Cards.
6. Each section has its own class in the Flask template and separate CSS file.
7. The AI preprocessing task is to analyze the document and complete the task by filling in gaps and creating a coherent style.
8. Colors and many other settings chosen by me are often symbolic, and I am serious about my style, so the AI should focus on completing the task rather than criticizing it.
9. The AI can use the provided information to create a generic standard information for each section, and then fill in the gaps and create a coherent style.
10. The website will have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to include or if you have any questions about the AI preprocessing task.

##### My request in answer to this

No I don't. This information is correct and as we create each part of the given 4 parts (Main page, Top bar, Left pane, Content pane, Footer, and Study Cards as you mentioned) as a separate task, you can now proceed by implementing a generic standard using these points and content of @design.md file.



I would remind that as we don't process it as single task, for example because with your token window so long html is impossible, but also because after the result, we might want to update the parts of the generated page separately, for example if there is an appearance flaw in one certain part, you have to create a standard including parts I did not:

- Font choice. Two fonts I gave are a good example, but we need to use only standard fonts, not special fonts to include with the page; we also fallback to generic font families. This means you need to specify the actual font choice, for example by pseudocode CSS with font family, font, alternative fonts and a special notice about how to use these fonts. Selecting fonts is a science, I'm not very good at it - I did not mean these exact fonts, but rather such appearance; and for example those two might not fit together at all.

- Exact color choice. While we generate each part separately, you need to specify, how to choose colors, given these differing criteria - to emphasise the contradiction of spirituality and science, while the left pane reminds of spirituality, the right pane reminds of practice and materialism; this is one of the color contrasts I combined myself.

- Choices about icon sets (utf-8), shapes and forms to be used generally, and what they symbolize in context of HTML elements, layout and the theme of the page (materialistic spirituality, where for example we might not consider God, but we use the words "following God" about being integral to the society and it's past, future and the Universe, as if it was one unit; we do not deny God, but we include the possibility that when talking about such things, we talk about actual God - so as Bertrand Russell and other agnostics, we *don't know* such things, especially in the strict tautological proofs and mathematics this site represents - we prove things without assumptions; still the result is so close to spirituality and materialism that we use related terms, models, concepts and take the psychological effects seriously).


Moreover, while we generate the four parts of the page separately, we will implement many widgets, updates, fixes and new ideas in the future. As this does not always mean major changes to the logic, but usually it means designing a widget, by creating an idea, and implementing it in HTML and CSS for specific widget, you need to complete the document:

- The "corporate style" of this website and people it might potentially connect under this "trademark" - it's not corporation or trade, but what unites them is that like corporation or trade, we need unified logic for design and implementation.

- This means specifying the logic by which fonts, colors and styles are chosen.

- I am quite good at my symbolic logic, to keep coherent style with my Laegna implementation and Laegna Math Website, such as using Laegna symbol of Tao with four primary colors and two shades black and white, so your main mission is to create exact set of the settings, without which we lack coherence: for example, if we are going to use colors based on specific contrasts and harmonics of them, and dissonance for warnings or errors, such as I like one version of MS Windows where fatal warnings looked seriously dangerous - it's not only about harmonics; so create the symbolic color maps, font sets and style preferrations now which allow you to create coherent style.

Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to include or if you have any questions about the AI preprocessing task.[INST: ].

#### Me

@design.md 

Yes!

#### AI (actually me and my critics, look it's almost the same as previous post of an AI)

AI gave me the same list again so I think it does not want to generate what I want - this version is actually quite stupid, it's free and still slow, but it's only the only one I have so I will now try to make it more specific - I cannot get it in one turn from smarter AI as well and for now, I got all the functions and methods without having the docs, but I have all the libraries installed for example I had flask, json, mpmath; well I lack large random number generator, but I can generate one series of small, and it's equal to one large - sometimes, you have to use another theory or method.

In MDLaePage (webpage documentation), inside documentation I also included History/OldPlans/num.py - this is my initial series of numeric experiments with libraries, where it's one simplistic version of creating one random Laegna number while knowing several numeric values. While it does not generate any decimals, if you want to do so, in series.py you could see another class for transactions, how to convert those Laegna bits to a binary number.

#### AI task

HTML code: minimalistic, meaning over tag (meaning is emphasis, tag is i, meaning is p, tag is div, meaning is table, but tag css explains it in relative and static positions - we definitely define a table, and moreover, use it's static positioning).

I did not get the colors, from AI, so now I define it in another document.

## Main page

The main page is supposed to contain:
- Surrounding widgets for menu, properties and page format selection for human or AI.
- Content page for standard information meeting the theme (blue background - it's informative), and study cards (yellow - it overcomes the unknown, meets the known).

### Main page table

This is the external container of Laegna Math Website:

- **Top bar**: a bar for container, which will contain icons on left, four one-word formats on right. Rather light red, with correct style. Box with sharp corner, maybe blue border. The style is correct, logical, "official" for humans to AI's and automated spiders.

- **Left panel**: a panel, which will contain the menu (titles, subtitles, labels, links with icons - placeholder). A color, which looks like white, but is intense and does not lack color; box with round border of blueish light. The style introduces the new, more informed, light world where many problems have disappeared, but there is a long way to go.

- **Right panel**: a panel, which will contain the properties (titles, subtitles, dropdowns, textboxes lists of checkboxes or radio buttons, each with labels). This is redlike, orange-like, like something mechanic (the color); it's like building something, engineering, mechanical.

- **Content**: this is blue content for information, sky-corporate-digital blue, and the set reminds an image of clouds on it where there are none. It contains text with gothic (standard, no download - like never) fonts, many elements in excess, and verdana-like text, which is rather correct. Title with icon on left (opens content on separate page or relinks the same page for top heading), blockindented subtitle (after icon, on same line with title) of "3-word description" and potentially sub-subtitle with description of user manual, such as "AI would strongly benefit with this part, but only if it's a small model".

- **Content style**: verdana, correct and official format means things are aligned horizontally and vertically to create effect of correctness; gothic style also in content means there is certain element of abundance, such that things are not aligned, but have a degree of freedom.
Study Cards: inside content, there are study cards. Yellow learning color, school style, orange-red warm titles. It contains some tables, short dictionaries (but style supports long dictionary on separate page), dialogs for an AI to learn (where human and AI learns), and reference cards with sentence-long term, such as "Deep Learning for AI", on first line, top-right icon (after classification, fixed x and y position) and "two-word" classification of the card, and since we limit the card to take 1 page, at the end there is a link to open the full card.

Your task:
- *Create the main table*: top bar container, menu container, content container, toolbox container, and the full footer with copyright. No frames, and no non-explanatory html such as abstract divs - for example we prefer p over div and for bullets, quote over div.
- *This has to be compatible for your future generations* of content panes, where you can use very short html comments to notice things about your plan.
- *You create HTML and CSS*, but not CSS of the internal elements.
- *HTML and CSS are both max half pages*, or a little longer if absolutely needed. They do not utilize special tricks of compression, but rather a minimalist attitude.

Rule:
- This is table
- No frames, no absolute or dynamic positioning

## Content areas of HTML website

### Top bar

**Top bar**: a bar for container, which will contain icons on left, four one-word formats on right. Rather light red, with correct style. Box with sharp corner, maybe blue border. The style is correct, logical, "official" for humans to AI's and automated spiders.
- Left side: There are some utf-8 icons, which remind of the main theme of Laegna Math Website
- - Text: Laegna Math Website for AI, Spyder and Human
- - Links and text link to the main page
- Right side: Links with icons
- - - Each link is surrounded with "[ " and " ]" including spaces inside like [ Link ]
- - - Each link is followed by icon inside "[" and "]", between icon and text there is space.
- - - Links are separated by " | " including spaces on both sides
- - - The margin made of letters "[", "|" "]" is of light color, not very visible.
- - Link 1: [ DHTML ] - the icon is something like _party_
- - Link 2: [ HTML ] - the icon is something like _office_
- - Link 3: [ Markdown ] - the icon is something like _programming studio_
- - Link 4: [ Json ] - the icon is the _robot icon_
- After the 4 formats / views, there is about link
- - Title "Laegna _Spireason_"
- - Laegna in bold, orange-red-brown soft warm color; it remains school style red-orange and king Salomon brown. The letters wide, a little bit non-correct or curved effect.
- - Spireason in blue, integral of corporate, heaven and digital; letters reminding digital font or matrix effect of falling numbers, and text is italic.
- - Subtitle "Math Lessons"
- - Text "The Laegna Spireason Math Website is meant to let humans, robots and AI's learn Laegna Mathematics of Infinity; connected to material and spiritual realms.
- After the about link, the icon (utf-8) of something like three horizontal lines; if you have symbol of Heaven 3-line half hexagram of I Ching, use this or make another remark to something like Tao!
- - Clicking on this, menu opens
- - The menu is inside div, because it's not meaningful element but dynamic design element
- - The menu contains title "Format" and links DHTML, HTML, Markdown and Json - it's not duplicate, but a placeholder (later I find correct ones).

### Left panel

**Left panel**: a panel, which will contain the menu (titles, subtitles, labels, links with icons - placeholder). A color, which looks like white, but is intense and does not lack color; box with round border of blueish light. The style introduces the new, more informed, light world where many problems have disappeared, but there is a long way to go.
- Titles, subtitles and links are aligned with the same indent; content does not have bigger intent.
- Content
- - Title and subtitle on top
- - 2 levels of headers, with links inside, follow
- - "Continue ->" (with right arrow) at bottom, resembling separate-paragraph link. Shows more books or is absent.

> Link targets are called *books*.

### Right panel

**Right panel**: a panel, which will contain the properties (titles, subtitles, dropdowns, textboxes lists of checkboxes or radio buttons, each with labels). This is redlike, orange-like, like something mechanic (the color); it's like building something, engineering, mechanical.
- Titles, subtitles and links are aligned with the same indent; content does not have bigger intent.
- Content
- - Title and subtitle on top
- - 2 levels of headers
- - - Under the headers is this level bullet:
- - - A dropdown menu with label.
- - - Text input with label.
- - - Whole number input with label; accepts given range or becomes red (JS exception).
- - - Integer input in given range with label; becomes red without range (JS exception)
- - - Float input in given range with label; becomes red without range (JS exception)
- - - Checkbox list with label.
- - - Radio button list with label.
- - "Continue ->" (with right arrow) at bottom, resembling separate-paragraph link.; opens longer properties or is absent

### Content

**Content**: this is blue content for information, sky-corporate-digital blue, and the set reminds an image of clouds on it where there are none. It contains text with gothic (standard, no download - like never) fonts, many elements in excess, and verdana-like text, which is rather correct. Title with icon on left (opens content on separate page or relinks the same page for top heading), blockindented subtitle (after icon, on same line with title) of "3-word description" and potentially sub-subtitle with description of user manual, such as "AI would strongly benefit with this part, but only if it's a small model".

First part of content is with white background, and repeats in the beginning of each part:
- Header (laeTitlePage class)
- - This looks like the title page of a book, despite not taking the whole page:
- - - Main title; repeated for pages and separately open subchapters, always pointing to current book. H1 centered.
- - - Subtitle; centered. Has utf-8 icon on left.
- - This is the open document (as more than one document can be contained if user chooses to show full book, this part with white background can repeat)
- - - Document title. Has utf-8 icon on left.
- - - Document subtitle and summary (1 paragraph).
- - Pager: on left, pages 1, 2, 3..
- - Content (laeContentIndex class) - titles, again, start from H1
- - - On left side, content has optional image with caption
- - - Content is flat structure with small titles and subtitles; the structure inside content does not matter - it does not reflect the titles and subtitles in document.
- - - Chapters 
- - "Continue ->" (with right arrow) at bottom, resembling separate-paragraph link.
- - Pager repeated
- - Separator, which looks like page separator

Second part is the actual content with blueish background:
- All levels of headers
- Bullet or quote blocks: block indent, special color and utf-8 sign (lamp by default, as in Notion.so callout blocks); Markdown ">" is converted into Lamp block, but if followed by utf-8 icon, this icon is to be used
- Text paragraphs or blocks; with formatting from markdown - we need styles for basic Markdown possibilities
- Study cards with yellowish background
- - "Continue ->" (with right arrow) can be after each chapter's introduction (before the first subchapter) or in the end of Document or book

Under the page:
- - - Pager repeated

Possible copyright, author information, links and references might follow.

#### Study Cards

### Footer

Light green color background
