# _Geometry of Relative Infinities_, __Geometric Infinities__:

__Relational Infinity__: this states that completely infinite subsystems can be measured in regards to their relative mappings.

_First Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Infinities in Accelerations__: given that change of velocity is discrete, change of acceleration can not be measured within _X_, despite relating by numbers, such as tangent of x and y of change.

_Second Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Point and curve angles__: point and curve angles are _relational_ in sense that they can be measured and compared, but their relative angle compares like zero and one, or like one and infinity: it proves the relational mappings of infinities.

_Third Geometric Theorem of Infinities_, __Dimensionality of a Shape__: when we change dimensionality, such as from line to square with sides of equal length, we cannot measure the relative numbers within _X_ and they do have relative size such as the edge of a square can be compared to the length of the line.

__X__: _X_ is the finite number space.
