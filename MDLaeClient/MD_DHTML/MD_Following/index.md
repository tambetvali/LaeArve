# Following

People, who follow, have to do this given the Creative Commons for Scientific (scientific paper) and Public (GPL, creative commons, spiritual-material, religious-scientific, solved-philosophical Úiotae ǘ combination.; this is the v with upwards accent - let's trust designers, this one has to look really cool) use.

Let's say, somebody clicks on "Follow" link, where there is number, like (10) followers.
- He has to have either clone of this site, or html which has down-wards structure (this can be separate view like "?view=json" or "?view=Markdown", easy to use for modified spider of ours/mine).
- There must be some books, which they list, each having the content in urls with only addition to file tree, not removal from it, so it's in one folder and subfolders in their server drive, along with relevant materials, but not much more - maybe something personal or collective to them, maybe a poem or two - but the structure does not disable poems, one can create a poem book and it could be either Latin or Laegna dialects of a language; where Latin invention is worldwide use of Arabic number system with digits 0-9, innovation at that time.
- They have to give their link and the list of books.

## Your website

> __TODO__: Implement the following functionality, you can do it yourself and commit if you really took time to program something, I would barely be followed like this so it's not an additional effort. I think I implement some of this.

Add the following code:

> __TODO__: for "file=filename", give "follow.py" at that subfolder of given chapter, in attach/follow.py in given example. 

TODO: Move the comment into paragraph and leave an example line only in the code.

__Python Code 1__, _python code for following_, file="follow.py":
```python
# Create a python file and in summary, write "# run: /follow/?user=laegna; http://127.0.0.1:5000/link/to/my/books [if condition is met else run]" on this line and replace the link with yours. You can also create your book in my git, but I don't plan to have server resources so I might accept, but selectively use these. I think the server must execute all the pages like books, docs, subdocs, nested docs, and the code blocks with firewall of executing only the following py file, would run this first line like bash to turn your code executable. The Code can recursively display a copy of itself, disable the default copy, create a Study Card, dynamically generate Study Cards, create a book or document or dynamically execute them; creating means: the variables are saved and next time it's executed, it checks whether the code is met. Each time a page is touced, it will run the code in client side, and the server might want to run it; client=True or server=True are the tags, and setting the other one False is optional, if you have a very stupid chat bot. We have to run the first commented line in separate python, the motherboard, with command execution class.

from follow.py import FollowBase

Class Follow(FollowBase):
  def __init__(self, follow=True, yoururl="http://domain.form.com/", yourbook="book1/", myurl="http://127.0.0.1:5000", mybook="/my/personal/links/book1", myname="My Name", myage=None, mysex=None, add more...):
    super.__init__(self, only my parameters)
    # TODO: do something

  def addLinkTo(self, mypage="/my/personal/links/book1/AIStudyCard", myprogram="@chapter12.examples/program.py" or None, mypage="@chapter12.examples"):
    super.addLinkTo(mypage, myprogram=myprogram)
    super.addLinkTo(mypage, mypage=mypage)
```

You can put it inside your own class and you need to add main-level code, which would create an instance of Class Follow (I like the Capital for my pseudocode, it put some special emphasis on each class like I do in my text), and you add links to each chapter, and execute each program for people who accept your following registered on my site.

TODO: Create a possibility to register users, where they see the Inbox, Spam, Trash folders of the Followers of my site, starting with myself (whether they want to see the default content). They can accept followers, share their accept lists, for their followers attach programs and virtual pages of their own, with their user like /user:username/ contained in the link parts.

## Implementation

To implement following, you:
- Send an email with your Markdown
- Add the content to your own book, where it's like a "Licence" to be followed; which can be used by my LaePage and it's users. Given the functionality even exists - I am rather bothered with the main functionality
- You can create some functions about what you mean by "following", and submit a Markdown which could use your Study Books or other code, to my GitHub, where I could accept it, or become user of my LaePage and create a book, which might be somewhere in chapter tree of the References or Sources.

The case of having the "Licence" on your page is like a passport, and you could put it even on static Markdown or Json page; you could use the code on HTML page - in any case, there are various ways to use it and to integrate it on my page, or for an AI to understand that if it's user intents to Like you, they can be Like you by asking the AI to understand what it means to generate these cards in the context of book given by you, and without me, your users can trust you; or you make a fork of my book and this rather _would_ use your Generation.
