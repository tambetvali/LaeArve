# This is the low-level reader of PyDown and
# MarkDown files, which is able to parse
# very simplistic set of identifiers:

# Instead of Python's automatic documentation,
# we prefer free-form documentation of Python
# and we align it differently. We use the
# Python comments to contain proper Markdown
# format, and we do rather dumb parsing:

# we need no additional complexities.
