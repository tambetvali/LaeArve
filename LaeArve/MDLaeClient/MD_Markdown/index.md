# MARKDOWN

## Outer headers

Each header, from main level title to chapters, menus etc. is preserved. This means, markdown output does not compile a design, but contain those straightforward.
- Markdown might contain References, but in the end of Reference card, second-level title "Sources, References and Links", which can be attributed as "References" in Markdown parser's owner class, the site's main menu or "Books" section is added.

It starts with The page and Math website titles, and creates an effect of the Title Page, giving user a freedom to apply such template or design one.
TODO: It's meant to be converted to different formats by user, given the need of their print or their bot; maybe a metadata would be added, which identifies start and end lines and characters (a selection), perhaps also a box selection, and assigns @references to be used in python scripts and in creation subdocuments and nested documents or study cards on pages; to be assigned in tags of the documents, used as targets in links or given a special attribution, also to be used as a context of discussions, dictionaries and other study cards: when our site robot is talking to an AI, it would selectively create random contexts out of what is assigned, and spider is using an AI trainer, which either is able to attach the document and link the part, add the document to the training list and maybe Spider would have later some methods to do internal circulation and keep such reference, maybe even with original selection / link and to create precognitive caches for this purpose.

## References

Contained as a chapter, either the last one or at position where user added it.

## Tools

Using inline HTML, additional tools can be added - it's name is a "GET" request parameter, automatically. Before them, the basic main tools are added, and after them the special main tools.

## Content

Which is not a special chapter, is a content chapter.

Part before first title can be opened with "Properties" dialog, which is considered to be a subdocument, at the main header of level one, which follows. If level one does not follow, but levels 2-6, they are turned into levels 1-5 of this document, and virtual level 7 is converted to actual level 6.

## Footer

Added to end of content in initial versions, is user's content, in dictionary format such as "__Name__: Tambet VÃ¤li." on separate line.

## Header

Formats with view property, where properties page could later have redirect to user's own page in this format or code could be extended to _support_ this format, not to have it on every page necessarily.

Dynamic links could be extended, user's subtitle added to Laegna Math Webpage or other page, and subtitle would be added, which is every time different, with fonts and colors. Icon list could be changed, but in case we get an AI it would fix it in size of having not many, and in content of having things like "commercial", "favourite", "followed".
