# Julia

Very optimized dynamic language for mathematical needs, where it's otherwise normal programming language, but mathematically very elegant. If you write code for mathematical theory, use this.

For practical application, Python might feel more powerful: in Julia, design your math and it's beautiful representation / visualization.
