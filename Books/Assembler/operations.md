# Ø‡ Operations

With 4 Laegna letters, one can write the operations.

You need to notice R and T of the digit:
- T: it consists of 4 possible values.
- R: it has positional value, which is nothing in case of one digit; in case of 4 digits it's many values, within 4 dimensions vs 1. When R is growing, the positional power is growing, but if we use it as a digit: we use all those multidimensional values as a straight line.

You need to consider that an operation uses T as a lower, R as a higher frequency:
- You can see how multiplication maps into square space, and addition to normal space, digitwise where you see that the digit has positional symmetries inside; if you use several digits as one digit ("{dddd}" for four-digit precision digits), you see that there are one-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate systems for multiplication and addition.

If you make multiplication completely linear, the linearly positioned number appears as a square, where ones (1) exist in a matrix, where you could see matrix multiplication could be half octaves up from normal multiplication, in this sense. Indeed, in several dimensions where you could map them dimensional power.

With addition, you don't do this: each position only takes care of the very same position, which is zero dimensions.

In one dimension, you would go through each position once, but compare it to each other.

Here, reversing the mapping and dividing them to Dens, and using the common values of Den counterparts, you use dimensional factor along with matrix - truth value table - of four values for 2\*2 Dens, which is Denet, or 4\*4 Ten structure, Tenet; in each case you are able to describe your simple operations like this. Contra paradoxes, you have additional sets of 2 (you use 2 Den matrices or Denets, one for R and other for T, for each digit, but they can be equal if for example you want good in the past and for the future), or a set of 4 values:
```
I O A E  E
E I O A  A
A E I O  O
O A E I  I
```
or 2 values (if R and T are equal, you got _binary Matrix_ of Laegna):
```
O A  A
A O  O
```

In each case: if the causal effect of two variables creates them _identity mapping_, they need a separate frequencer, which takes only one value, but does an operation with it: it's now a different scale, linear instead of matrixal, and you got equal amount of linear discrete values towards future, as many you got two-dimensional values before; but actually as it was square matrix, you got linear squared space, and you can see it's in different vibration: the values do not map to anything in each others. So you cannot do this without those additional bits of information, but you can turn them more expressive indeed to map each value, for example considering they are T and there is R mapping, either conflict or resolution for example in this condition, where it would map two persons in interaction.

For each binary operation, you got these 4 combinations in addition to 4*4:
- For example, berber paradox is solved if this is AO, where A means both values now map as True, berber does it to himself, and also he is done it, where the value does not match the other square, but matches itself. Turing Halting Problem would also give False if the both won't map. Liars paradox, indeed, is in this situation a logical contradiction (halting your programs is generally not, nor the situation in the village, which can be easily solved so that all work is done, as we have the barber and he can cut himself, after all, with some exceptions where we use OO as the right column values).
