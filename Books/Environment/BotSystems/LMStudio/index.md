# LM Studio - the Server System

While this includes a bot as well:
- You can copy _Brains with Knowledge_ (I use this as a shorter form to say "Models") in gguf format into it's model directory.
- You can serve chat models and use them from your programs.
- You can serve embedders and use them in your documentation registry and it's clients.

This is beneficial if you arrange a bot, which is able to answer based on Documentation, or "talk with your Documentation" feature - a nice language enchange reminding me some of my own language as well, so it would align :)
