# This class, Eagerly, reads the page content in Markdown format,applies Laegna Architecture on the abstraction,
# and outputs HTML or other output format, such as DHTML.

# This is the example code for the main functionality, while the actual code used in the system can contain
# implementation details and specifics to the implementation and is not meant to be used solely as a
# reference material.

# Based on reference code, the general structure is supposed to be easily updateable by AI, which can discriminate
# between essential and between the implementation details, which do not matter so much. The documentation is perfect
# if, removing the implementation, an AI would more or less automatically reach the system with same functionality.
