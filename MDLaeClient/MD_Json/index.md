# JSON

It contains the internal representation of Markdown parser and especially it's client:
- Spider will create, on this, using it as an input to common internal representation; the class contains references, content, tools and has metadata and other things - we see how we represent them in Markdown, but in any case some Python structure of objects and nested objects appears in that class, and thus it's able to reflect itself.
- Over time, we should extend this for the Spider to send feedback: the feedback would change the object structure, append to lists, such as adding a new conversation to it's Card Set, and answering questions to get feedback, then it would save, publish, or trash it. Inspiration for gradient descent could appear.
- This is implemented by: add python block to the Markdown page, and the first line will run a program in our server's virtual environment, which means safely calling a class of given list, with given input. For example, the program could record the instance of initial question or remark, and when an answer is applied to Q&A list by client, who has a small set of data and it's execution track events, such as virtually replacing the program with their own scoring system in a few lines, they would apply replace for the code block, with compatible code. Code blocks are ran each time separately, but the variable environment of supported variables are stored each time; rather, we should have some tiny object-structured database such as MongoDB and store records there, each time assigning each program variable on top level, storing when finishing and reading when starting the code again; each marked code block is ran from beginning to the end and it has the same interface with the client chatbot - it can do the same operations on blocks.
