# User as a Developer

Imagine an user, who has given different development tasks.

While we have not much to do with completely unintelligent people here, who will use some derived work from actual science, not the deep math itself: we can have many users, who are not advanced in programming.

This leads to conception I would call _User as a Developer_ and which would emerge in times of an AI.

## Learn the API format of programming

Programming on it's basis, in era of AI, can consist of the following (let's call it t√∫programming, to have Laegna prefix for this _modified activity_):
- Learn API language and structure
  - Consider written representation
  - Consider graphical UML representations

You can download:
- UML editor
- Any editor, which allows for graphical, for example simulated freehand, depictions of the User Interface

Imagine an API description, when user will _teach_ a program:

```
You are a basic math operator set, able to do computations with two inputs and one output: two numbers, an operation, and the result.

You have the following access:
- Plus: input, two numbers; output: their sum
- Minus: input, two numbers; output: their difference
```

You cannot design a major architecture, but you can imagine that your program needs such API. With help of an AI, you can describe the API, which is the _Interface_. Then, you can ask it to turn it to programming code, keeping the checklist about how it relates to original description. As a result, you can implement it as a library for the widget you develop, where you don't know the architecture, but you know the need for subtraction and addition.

I have an idea to define a Markdown format, which can be seen as an user-implemented program by an AI, which would translate it to more formal language, leaving some for interpretation.

Given the following:
- User would learn API structures and testing.
- User would not mind implementation details.

The actual level of competence has much lower requirements of time investment and personal intelligence of engineering and math.

Basically, what you get:
- AI implements a form, where there are two commands visible:
  - Plus
  - Multiply

When you click on one, the form opens:
- Two inputs are visible
- One output is visible, but gray
- Once you fill two inputs, you get the output

The user can carefully tune this, to achieve OOP: while the user cannot describe __how__, they could understand that to make balance of money, they need two operations. They describe the meaning and use of the operations in API interface or import from Markdown files and UML diagrams, for example actions.

While AI also struggles in creating grand designs, the user can _plug_ the resulting work into where they have:
- Input, which they describe as Table: they add input, and create two columns product and price.
- They ask the AI to use the inteface to keep the balance, and sum each row. For an intelligent AI this is so simple that it would fill the gaps.

Notice: while we need less programming in future, we need to carefully formulate our goals and methods, goals and means: having mixed formal and vague input, an AI is able to _fix the latter_; having only vague input for long time: it would start to _yield_.

Human have intuitive perception of Truth: things which are _useful_, things we _make use of_, and things we _don't need_ or _don't want_. AI can repeat our patterns, be creative with them, but it needs _statistical amount of original input_ or it creates internal feedback cycle, which cannot accumulate Truth. Human Truth is our survival: AI can handle some logic and patterns, but somewhere there is the human-point, to actually _give value_ to what is made, in any sense.
