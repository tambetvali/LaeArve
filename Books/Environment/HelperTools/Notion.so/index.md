# Notion.so

Here, you have only x blocks as non-paying client, but you can create your primary documentation in WYSIWYG and AI-compatible tree; you can download markdown and html, and some limited set of pdf.

You run out of trials with it's chat and you cannot have password-protected public sites in free version. Zapir can link here.

Some systems are readily up with all the AI if they get Notion.so link to your documents, especially well-functioning if you pay (and free models, even in Open Source community, are so hard to get that we assume money in running large models or for long time without testing).
