# Here are some old projects to keep, because each of them was a little off. I usually start many times and reach some kind of weakness not obvious initially.

For me it's some historic value of my old notes, but perhaps it's a real history :) It's typical that initially you run into technical problems after five first sentences or your file is simply empty. I have even older ones, but the computer is broken and I think I will not recover this, even if I still somewhat have it - I think I did not install an OS another time, because it already happened too often.

Surprisingly few given how many times I started :P
