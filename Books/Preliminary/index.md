# Laedeck: Laegna Preliminary School

Notice: Code Assistant systems, given the relevant parts of this, could implement it as a whole.
- For this, you have this version: [History Recording of First Version of Laegna Preliminary School / Laegna Fantasy](History/Laegna/FirstVersions/LaegnaFantasy).
- With the first version, you use the AI task.

This task will remain, without implementation, in Historic notes:

This book implements preliminary processing of pre-Laegna numbers into an index system we are going to need.

We are going to:

Introduce free number system to computer.

Introduce T and R frequencies with mixed dynamic and static properties, but enough of each for computer programmer who needs to combine them.

We implement Laegna calculations about relative infinities, but using decimal-based decompression of numbers. Each number has one- and two-dimensional component.

## Basis

Here, we are doing several Laegna tips and tricks while using normal decimal system (in the root project) or binary, hex etc. We work hard to give these number systems some Laegna properties, or to figure out how one can make use of their similarities and what is the role of properties of orginal decimal system and it's family, in Laegna. Finally, hopefully, we reach Laegna numbers: ones, which make the bes use of each of the properties we describe, in our best understanding.

Decimal System:

Provide Laegna _decompression_ on decimal digits, emulating Laegna Behavior.

Provide given in base x, using digits and simplest letter alphabets starting like dec, then appearing like hex, and then approaching further to end of alphabet. Numeralizamos this into a hack: I use Python's "range", which I don't need at this position, to provide digit in it's own digit space: digit t in first position, the highest position (of r, the _range_ why I use the _range_ operator), which gets sense by it's height, on second position, and the lowest possible position on third. This is because we want to emulate Laegna decimal numbers - which can be decoded by alphadecimal decoder alone, we use simplest latin much like ASCII-127 or ASCII-128, what number it seems to be as well, in Laegna that would make sense as we have then 8-e container, not 8-9 or 8-10 if we count decimals from one, not Zero.

But Decimal System is going through all Laegna Magic now, in the simplest way possible, generalizing each object as if in one-dimensional world.

Perhaps we teach decimal calculations in space without order, where you perhaps want to point out much more relations in two free axes: velocity axe of +- and related letters, with acceleration axe on the other.

Perhaps with frequencers, you separate them inside if:

- We generalize the decimal system into one multidimensional digital system. It's 3*3 square, and each following digit value must neutralize the number system. Then, we can map how the decimal system could exist in the bigger frequential space! The last digit, whatever it is: we still use 0, just an external opposition of 5; but the following letters have their own positioning: each is positioned to least dimensional space, which can keep it. We don't contain any negative digits as we put them separately, facing downwards, to lower frequency; we keep the positive dimensional scope of every digit, and with every value, which is full number squared, attach new positions. We might use 16-positional symmetry of this table matrix where we want to map Laegna Complex numbers, where real and imaginary numbers, thus also the decimal-`18`, are connected by simple basis.

So we generalize and create editable Laegna number templates on these scales:
* Each number is converted to decimal, which knows it's _range_, and if we go further, we can do idealized recordings on any axe: using R digits, we move the axe along and not against any number, where we can measure the full-axe relations and symmetries freely, in which statistical case, we achieve left-hand, first very generalized, but then more particular by analyzing possibilities and possible reflections, for example, on imaginary axes of h, which exists outside-scope.
