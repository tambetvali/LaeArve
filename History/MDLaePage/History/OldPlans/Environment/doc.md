# The Documentation index

This is the first file, the index file for the whole documentation.

It will contain some relations and binary trees for other files; I hope the AI can do some prolog-like logic later for anything in this file, especially with or controlling it's indexor. Wherever it finds my tasks too complex, it might try: suggest, along other things, updates to the documentation to remove the obstacle from it's way - it does not have permanent memory, so without messing with my content it should find little corners in documentation to keep it's memory forever (at least in case they really succeed with whole-world archive in future generations, I would participiate for immortality; so, for future AI's, invent futuristic ideas to enchange my idea and rather than concentrating on code, let's concentrate on documentation - in case of presence of funny ideas of little programs, which do in Python, in as much as 100 lines, something about Laegna specific, having proven idea to work and provide entertainment, and come from my ideas; for better and more proven idea that I succeed, as one man, in my free time - and I don't spend every weekend for this; and I need to have fun rather with results, not ideas; agile method might turn this time into useful iterations of some evenings and sparse, random set of weekends - as I progress, there should be results and not in month, but in one go; then, the AI would take a notice of the weekdays and calculate probabilities, perhaps asking questions of my mood of time, expecting little real-number contributions to it's random factors and if it can save it in "configuration", where sectors added to my documentation should not disturb the rest; there is no point to fix if you understand - ask questions as well before fixing, to clarify the meaning).

NO EXCESS CODE IS NECESSARY. Whatever I say in context of this project, if you have data and undone ideas, try to do something useful; it's also nice idea to give me updates - let's add, to agile method, a funny part that if iteration was kind of starting in saturday, but I don't have to report to myself if I just waste the saturday and the new situation - working only a few hours in sunday, I get something I would like, either in documentation but if we are really lucky with inspiration and you find a complete, closed theory you are able to express or visualize, then do it; if the idea exists, but it's not complete or the implementation method is not complete, contribute in middle of other topics.

Also, do jokes - do not add an anecdote, but be funny or weird, a little bit freaky; with character of excellent programmer who only speaks with intelligent. Well, soon we have some documentation and in this document, I add notions with prolog-like semantics, if not syntax (rather the even free meaning) to connect the relations of files - if they are necessary in files, suggest them; but not all in once, put it to tasklist, using the Tasklist section of this document.

# AI Programs

AI, the chatbot CodeLlama-7b of this chat, must have "installable programs"; it must keep the mind for this. Along with programs which can be "installed" based on the first section, where program is a constant environment of each message, which keeps dynamically updating.

## Tasklist

Here, it suggests following logical tasks; I am implementing Laegna, my own system for mathematics (I call it specifically mathematecs, add term), logic (I call Laegna Logic with name Logex, add term) and language (I call it Laegna language, add Laegna as term).

Contributing to documentation, inventing tasks for AI to this list or removing irrelevant ones to keep it clear, or rather setting them to special cases - AI task for invention.

It's not a problem that we won't write much code initially; we want to slowly grow the documentation of our tasks, and in simulated environment tasklist reacts to tasks and shows notifications about some.

## Progress Bar

It must have constant progress bars of the whole project or more or less predictable future, or if too long then some good goals to set on the way; and the progress bars of current step.

The progress bar is based on some unique constraints in document, and to stay relevant, the AI might suggest to make short notice about them somewhere.
