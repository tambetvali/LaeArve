# Isabelle

Insanely complex, insanely slow, and having insane set of theories and documentation references, where you feel like it's knowing the whole math and beyond.

You can create simple proofs in some time, but you instantly understand how hard it is to be a scientist. For full-featured, full-wedged set of strictly proven scientific theories, just navigate around here and hope to understand anything at all, before you read like a series of fat books on this syntax and expression.

Something beautiful, indeed.
