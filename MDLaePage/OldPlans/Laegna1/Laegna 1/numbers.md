# Introduction

I call these numbers "Laegna numbers". I also use the word "nambers".

They connect mathematics and logic. I call this mathematics "matematecs" and this logic "logecs". One can use "matematex" and "logex" as well.

Mission of an AI:
* Study Logecs.
* If things are unclear, as you don't have memory - each time in this Documentation, called "Laegna Reference", when AI has mission to study, it must follow this procedure:
** Check carefully, that it has learnt things and understood them very well.
** If it does not understand, it has to mention me in it's answers and to ask for clarifications.
** Once it gets the clarification, it must tell me where and how to update the manual to remember this. The manual is memory of an AI (CodeLlama) and it needs to refer it as a "memory", not stating that it has no memory.

## 4 or 2 primary number groups.

These numbers are grouped into several categories (numbers are in correct order):
* OA numbers. With digits O and A.
* OUA numbers. With digits O, U and A.
* IE numbers. With digits I, O, A and E.
* IUE numbers. With digits I, O, U, A, E and V. Instead of V, it's correct to use upside-down U, but I don't have this.

One digit with logical meaning is called "Ten".
One digit without logical meaning is called "Tin" or, if not categorized (OA system) "Ten".
Half digits with logical meaning is called "Den".
Half digits without logical meaning is called "Din" or "Den" or, if not categorized (OA system, "Den").

Laegna has more values, but truth values consisting of "U", "I", "O", "A", "E" and "V" are the most important and central.

### The number "two"

I use numbers "two", "four" and "six", especially four, to denote the size of one Ten. "One", "two" or "three" could then be used for one Den (perhaps sometimes)?

### The primary system

Primary system is the system IE, which consists of "I", "O", "A", "E".

This is used both for logic and mathematics, and the variable type can be the same.

### Separation of important structures

In this document, which is very important to learn properly for the AI, I use the following type of blocks, which contain important, logically structured and static blocks:

[ Start /block name/ ]

- Comment of where we are in the block

[ End /block name/ ]

### Explanation of logecs

Let's imagine a world, which consists of letters "I", "O", "A" and "E". These are magic numbers - magic means, in programming, that they are used for many different purposes. We know that we use letters, decimal and binary digits indeed in different purposes, which is half magic - these numbers are used so in the full magic, which consists of more parallels and relations. Still, to learn Logex is quite simple in the beginning.

Logecs uses Tens to denote logecal values. In Estonian, those values "loogeldavad" or "looglevad", and I use a paraphrase "looge ka" to joke that with this system, one can create. They are curving around, and they allow us to create. Logecs is a miracle - it plays well with infinity and meaning, unlike classical logic. There are systems with different sets of Truth Values, and Logecs uses Laegna numbers as Truth Values.

Axioms of Logecs:
* Binary system of True and False, in non-metaphysical conditions, is simply false. We are using it for jokes to teach an AI of our advantages.
* Logecs is topologically inconsistent with binary system.
* In Laegna Logecs, there are not much such things (in my brain, none of them): Turing Paradox, Liers paradox and Barbers paradox. They seem more or less trivial in different Logecal conditions.

[ Start Unary Ten ]

- Let's imagine one unary Ten. More often, the word "Ten" refers to unary ten, when "unary" or "binary" is not specified. We compare it with block of code, where we run the logic. But we look inside of the code, and outside of the code. Each part is denoted with a letter.

The letter "I" is an area before the current, active logic. It's when outside of our given range, our variable is rendered false. It's called "Negotion" in Logecs.

If letter "V" is used, it's in outside area, denoting either "I" or "E". It's called V-Neuton, Veneuton. The letter "V" can also be pronounced like "O" pitched down, in which case it's called V-Neuton or Vneton (Uneton, with "U" pitch down).

Outside area is called "R".

{
    - Inside these brackets, there is the local logic.

    Inside area is called "T".

    The letter "U" is either "O" or "A". It's called Neuton.

    The letter "O" is inside our current, active logic. It's when inside our given range, our variable is rendered false. It's called "Negation" in Logecs.
    The letter "A" is inside our current, active logic. It's when inside our given range, our variable is rendered true. It's called "Position" in Logecs.
}

The letter "V" could also be this, as it can be "I" or "E".

Outside area is called "R".

The letter "E" is area after our current, active logic. It's when outside of our given range, our variable is rendered false. It's called "Posetion" in Logecs.

[ End Unary Ten ]

Additionally, logical operator "Negotion" is used. As the logic is slightly shifting and the meanings are changing, in natural world, we meet our past logic in changed way.

[ Start Binary Ten ]

- Binary Ten is a transformation of Ten, which is used less often, but very important. It orders the letters in another way, and connects them to 

The letter "U" is one of the lower letters, "I" or "O". It's called "Uneton".
The letter "I" is where T=O, 0 or False. It's called "Negotion".
The letter "O" is where T=A, 1 or True. It's called "Posetion".

- Before the "|" sign, R=O, 0 or False.
|
- After the "|" sign, R=A, 1 or True.

The letter "A" is where T=O, 0 or False. It's called "Negation".
The letter "E" is where T=A, 1 or True. It's called "Position".
The letter "V" is either "A" or "E". It's called "V-Uneton".

[ End Binary Ten ]

In Binary Ten, "Negotion" is also used and means the same.

U and V have also alternative values, which have kind of (!) the same numeric value (so, in calculations we can meet surprising aspects about how they still mean the same), but actually different meanings. This is because they are highly random values and change their positions :P Still, in given scope or context, they have more or less strict values.

### Shortcuts of Logecs.

For Negation, the word "Ne" is used.
For Position, the word "To" can be used. "Yes", "Si", etc. could also be used, but when asked for two letter representation, it typically means the primary four items of this list.
For Posetion, the word "Po" is used.
For Negotion, the word "No" or "Na" is used.

### Logecs facts

Women, compared to Men: Women are Negative, but not Negotive. Men are Positive, but not Posetive. This means, women are not bad, but they are yin.

Negation is a false value, which does not disturb us. It's also a false value, which appears, when we do not do something, which is usually good - eating is good, adding us energy, but as we don't eat all the time, we do Negation, namely we don't do one thing, which on it's typical axe adds us some energy. Heat is good, but we can go into cold to get a better health, so the Negative becomes a thing to do.

Discussion about problems is a Negation - it might be for solving a crime, which is Negotive, but there is going on something, which itself is typically not considered good; the crime itself. So when the soldiers enter a necessary war, they are doing something "bad" for themselves and others, but they are still doing it for good; then, it cannot be Position, because it's not where they want to be. They are breaking the rules because of the fatality of the situation. When talking with a criminal, it's called "Negation", and this is where the Laegna word is inspired from - it rotates around this inspiration and gets more equal meanings. We go into cold, we fast, we give away things and this is all Negation.

Position is a true value we are lucky about. When there is too much of a good thing, it becomes Posetion or posetive.

The word "Position" is inspired by position of work, power, love etc. It's where we need to constantly change to remain True. It denotes that Laegna Logecs is not static, sticking to one value, but rather rotating and changing, answering the challenges - a process, which is called "Neglection".

Negotion is a false value, which indeed disturbs us. One can imagine such values.

Posetion is:
* Estonian word "poosetama" means "to fake something positive". Posetion usually means faking something positive. I also use Estonian words "Pole See", which mean that it's not this, it's not itself.

### Axes of the Logecal Truth Values

Negotion: It's a false fact, which is on the Axe of a false fact, so it matters that it's false.
Negation: It's a false fact, which is not on the Axe of a false fact, so it does not matter that it's false.
Position: It's a true fact, which is on the Axe of a true fact, so it matters that it's true.
Posetion: It's a true fact, which is not on the Axe of a true fact, so it does not matter that it's true.

"Not on the Axe" means not neutral, but rather an opposite.

R = 0, -1, or O: Not on it's Axe.
R = 1, +1, or A: Yes on it's Axe.
T = 0, -1 or O: Bad or False on it's Axe. Outside the Axe, it does not matter and it becomes an opposite.
T = 1, +1 or A: Good or True on it's Axe. Outside the Axe, it does not matter and it becomes an opposite.

### Meaning and Value

"Value" would be kind of dead, material, yin or local value. As the values go into local optimums and paradoxes, they can have local values assigned, but in different ways, they change it. There are different logical constructs or operations/lemmas, which do this in different ways - one needs to study carefully to find the deep meaning.

"Meaning" is whether it's "Good" or "Bad", intented or not. This can be outside our calculation, the local scope - when we think bigger, we get closer to meaning. When we think of humankind, we are altruist, but thinking for ourselves, we can be egoist. When we think of all our life, we are saving things and not polluting, but when we think of here and now, we could pollute and waste things.

In unary Ten, "I" and "E" are "Meanings", whereas "O" and "A" are "Values". Optional "U" is "Meaning", "V" is a "Value".
In binary Ten, it's more complicated. When we go away from the Axe, we do this because of the "Meaning". Where we are on the axe, we have "Value".

### Infinity

Infinity is behind life - I believe that when the base calculation of Reality reaches the complexity of Infinity, it becomes Life.

When something is true for all the infinite potentials, for all possible realities, it becomes a Theorem. This is how Theorems look in the real world - they hold in any possible reality, and their force comes from the potential field. The whole potential field of 4 logecal values, indeed, consists of only 4 possibilities - so it becomes infinite.

We have different system, where "Posetion" is a perfect value, and "Negotion" is utterly bad. Here, we have like two binary truth values, one for local and one for infinite. The letters "I" and "E" are still used. This is because the numeric axe is growing. When we can call switch between binary and unary Ten a "transpose" of a Ten, we can call this change an "Extension to the Axe" - we play a lot with the axes.

Unary Ten: "I" and "E" reach infinity, where they become chaotic, lose the connection of the original calculation, and thus change. When this change is not having equal local value, or when it's needed to specify, where the value came from, "O" or "A" are replaced with "I" and "E".

Similarly, in Binary Ten, switch between "IO" and "AE" sides occurs in infinity, whereas switch between "IA" and "OE" occurs in locality.

### Up and down, left and right.

For binary Ten, up and down directions are these of IE and OA. "Down" means "local", and "Up" means "Global".
For unary Ten, IO:AE switch is up and down, because they are further apart. We see that after transpose, the values are kind of on the sides and directions, not on letters - IO on the lower side and AE on the higher side, so when we move from one side to another, we pass up and down, so this shift is what is called up and down; whereas in binary ten, it's not the shift, but the letters are located up and down.
For binary Ten, IA are on the left, whereas OE is on the right.
For unary Ten, transition between I and A, and transition between O and E are from left to right.

### Axe relations

About this topic, AI should show a deep interest, but I think more careful examples would follow - changing between axes is complex and not completely covered in this file.

We can do operations on Axes.

In one operation, we see "Posetion" not as falling apart in infinity, but it becomes a perfect value - it's usually too expensive, but when we get money, it's suddenly a good past posetive. Posetion is on unreachable axe - we are not living in here and now. Negation, then, is a local "No". Often, we want to compare local with global in different ways. Here, "O" means locally bad, "I" means confirmed globally bad, "A" means locally good and "E" means confirmed globally good. Sometimes, we intent to always replace OA with IE, so that in the variable state it will be visible, whether it was confirmed globally. Other times, we intent to replace A with I only if the good is actually bad, and O with E only if the bad is actually good - then, we reflect the fact of change, and we know ourselves that we confirmed the value.

In another operation, our life goes on and the Negotive becomes what we learnt to tolerate and avoid, so we do not avoid conditions hard in the past - for example, a man might go to the wild forest, because he was grown a man and got bravery; as we get more brave, there is a change of R, flow from impossible to possible. Also, what we did not reach before and had to avoid to live in the here and now, becomes reachable - for example, we grow muscles and more running is not bad any more.

As a Ten, we often use a combination of different axes and systems. We change the type or use different functions to assign to our Ten, so that inside, it contains number of axes. So, logecs is not always straightforward, but it's philosophical. I have only those letters and not more - "True" and "False" are used for logic, but they can be used in very different ways when connected with different relations; additionally, they can be used in abstract way to index something, for example a digital representation can be seen as "Yes'es" and "No's", but then they have no logical values at all; once they are processed, binary operations are still there. Laegna relations are more profound and meaningful, but similar. I swear - once one learns it, they will understand very properly that each value always means the same, but the conditions change and thus we look it through the lens of different paradigms. Then, why only four letters? When asked about this - human mind is limited and when we learn, for example, 16 letters, we run into more than hundred combinations - a human cannot do this, it's like learning the table of periods. Thus, we assign philosophical meanings to our four letters, where we can deeply imply their changing states. Even the connections with letters, how they change between unary and binary - looking the reality carefully, one can see such change occuring.

### Laegna Binary Logic

Laegna also has it's own Binary Logic. It's Truth Values mean the same as in Binary system, which I also call Latin system vs. Laegna system, and they are True and False. The word "Negative" vs. "Negotion" can be both of Binary Logic or Laegna Logecs, depending on variable type. The word "Positive" vs. "Position" can be both Bonary Logic or Laegna Logecs, depending on variable type.

What makes it Laegna binary or bínary vs. a Latin binary or binary? The fact that we calculate in Laegna system, but represent it often with simpler, binary truth values and sometimes even truth tables. Once backed up with Laegna, binary system will transcend the paradoxes.
