# Microbot documentation

Our system, Laegna Math Website with Server, Client in Browser, and Math library implementing our own Laegna Mathematics.

It's implemented in Python, Flask, Mistune. It utilized Markdown format for Data Storage and outputs DHTML, HTML, Markdown and Json.

Mission of our Microbot is to provide generative API in Question & Answer format, in Q&A&Context format, and the general website giving the same information. It includes generators of Math puzzles and static content of dictionary items, encyclopedy items and structured documents to introduce the generators.

## This Documentation

This is implemented as part of our Reflector, since
it's a reflection and simplification of our work.

As I installed GPT4All:
* It supports only short snippets of docs
* It's really better to resolve little tasks
* This is the site documentation in short sentences

We write here all the docs, which are needed to use
GPT4All kind of AIs: they get input as documentation
folder reference and use this in their answers.

GPT4All is slow in embedding, and it views the
answers in 512 char parts. Logically, we need one
version of docs, which has short and less context-
sensitive parts as it's basis.
