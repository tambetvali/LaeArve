# Stateless service

We do not trust in databases, local files, any server or user content - instead, we are running a stateless service.

Stateless service means: while building an user network, we don't expect users to have a server to provide our service, or to not run out of valuable trials (still being able to serve the results of their work, such as compatible scripts - for example, my website while I don't own a trial of Zapir, is tested with it's smallest bot and thus, the client can run into following iterations without me, for trial time and then with money - preferably they will run bigger models, but we expect them rather not to overfit their more valuable content).

We treat each piece of content carefully, and instead of adding anything to server automatically, our "users" will send commits to our Git; hopefully we don't get such a big environment ourselves to not trust our users: rather, I allow some 20 users initially and expect others to fork the content and be responsible on their user bases.

__Feedback Ping__:

_Feedback Ping_ is the service of Spider:
- It scans the Flask website for any of your followings
- It pings to those sites that it's following them, which it can verify by given address
  - It can ask for verification code to appear on the address, which can be manually added
    to server of static content, such as Neocities server for static HTML we trust in. It's rather completely free and you are unable to write and add so much to run out of the space; rather people are processing yours with slow bots.
- The sites, when they are pinged with the following information, with subsequent content to chapters included in the following site, and additional generators it could use directly or as templates.
- Who is following us, will be merged to our folder structure unless they are banned or not accepted, and they will be linked otherwise under Messages or under Spam. The content is randomly removed, and ping must happen before update would delete them after all. When user installs the site again, they would not notice much - it would collect pings in next few hours.
  - Who is blocked, can still be followed by Spiders, which trust such reasoning. Block might be posetive: "please, don't overestimate your implementation in your text", positive: "please finish your work and simplify the examples", which appears green, or negative: "please do not spam with your product advertisements", which appears yellow, or negotive: "please do not insult other users. you are banned for x days and remoderated/precommented by that user after this.", which would appear red and "dangerous" (like fatal errors in MS Vista, it's only advancement in design - for long time, "how more icons" or something disappeared, and it was the most unsuccessful of them not leaving a lasting family; but it _aimed_ a lot what they still don't have - it's like the blue screen story).

For example, a bot might give a template of users it would follow, then analyze their content and finally update listings of the template with exceptions and guarantees; then it would ping them to check out the page, and receive a key to check whether it's remembered, either blocked or forgot, and which of the given services are accepted, liked or blocked (also from autoimplementation, if available) by different users.

It is polite to send user an e-mail, ask for their feedback later, and connect to the users you follow; or then, to not be so interested about your content, but rather the possibility (also quite zen if eventually done as well).

I call it something like handcrafting: for our scientific work and it's references we are rather careful, and remember it's also accepted to run any python code on the site, unless you would require for example an user to use their colab - subsequentially, we can have git hubs in our account to allow different groups of users to maintain theirs.
