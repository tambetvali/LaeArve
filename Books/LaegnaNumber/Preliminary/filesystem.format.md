# Filesystem: How it's Formatted

We aim to provide good set of automatically generated opportunities to understand Laegna Math by examples of monotone part of the calculations.

User, which wants to train certain abilities, could recognize the simplistic calculation involved and assign a template, for example real-life example or two apples plus two apples being four apples. It should assign units to each component, and other variables, and solve the task of displaying this.

Each generator family must keep the context of it's programmatic hash:

Something like MemoryKey: 273428423RFFWREW in _Decimal Format for Indexing_ is good. We _index_ the numbers still in reference computer system, where the decimal and digital system are the first reference bases: binary, perhaps, is less than digital: it's not necessarily an automata, and open space with infinity-mapping abilities in inner space.

Index should contain the number space and the number. Now this is where it's important to refer the container variable size: Zero and Five are persistent numbers, the centers in this system as we don't want to change the order much. For example, if we have two-value implementation of two dimensions, where digit's presence of _four_ might be valuable approach in some interpretations of such compression.

Number is represented in such dimension:
* Matrix dimension (applicable if floating-point is used for a digit value, for example, instead of one digit, or if many such numbers are in squares in separate paragraphs, layers of the third; digit precision and zoomability are the common characteristics, which should be empathically implemented there - you cannot keep each theorem straight at every moment, but you map where their ends and beginnings would meet): This contains I-E scale of digit mapping, where the lines in line matrix become repeated in higher square matrix of two-linear matrixes (linear^2). Paragraphing should excpect the "diagonal digit" to be higher, adding one digit to the whole dimension of the matrix. In several ways, you have all the dimensions matrix would need, and some overleft. This _problem_ is _solved_ with _dimensionality_: and the Discrete Number Taradox for _dimensionality_, the contrary of Paradox en Laegnan ("en" would mean you can use the lower-frequency form as well, where you would meet it).
* Number line dimension, where each digit is separate position on a line, and strictly next by it's range - the X dimension.
* Subdigit dimension, where digits can have complex space.
