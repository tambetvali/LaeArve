# Infinity of Precision

## Cycular Infinities

__Laegna infinity-directedness__: Laegna number is defined so: with it's presence, it contains the infinite repetition of itself, and is defined as given subset of numeric space of this. This is proven by: numbers, when added, must end in infinity.

__Cyclular Operation of Precision__: for example, if we have number 123456, and do an operation, where 456 is cut off and only 123 is left, so that precision is lost: we can manipulate values of R, use the outer square of the number, and we can continue the repetition in other direction, so that we have 456123. We can count that we need often to fix this with local calculations, but for a rounded value: there is a theorem, that if it is directionally non-equal to it's repetition to infinity, it must be, by I and E, an actually different value. The fractal also holds to inside and to outside.

Numbers are digitwise, theoretically, optimized so that the half-octave it takes between projections from multiplication scale to addition scale, should not change the order of the digits and their content: in fractal structure, such properties are mapped the closest.

## How we keep the optimized numbers

As reality is not ideal, we think that the fractal property is easily broken: consider that in R, while in T there is some curvature of knowledge and development, in terms of acceleration even becoming over zero; in R also, we lose some precision initially and thus the fractal might not be there: ideally, we already measure the grand scale. This inherent brokenness is typical to Laegna numbers.

Consider that in higher space, you get the R rule mentioned: the infinity does not change everything around you accidentially, only by butterfly effects, but rather there is smooth fusion, and major change almost hidden in local acts; this kind of magnitude creates a statistical existence: while the statistics definitely closes it's ends, it's locally not visible. This happens in minor scale: only some statistical property is affected by many contributors to the same activity, many molecules might move to create a single effect. Statistics is a powerful system, especially Laegna Statesc.

We turn inwards:
- Smallest bit can be divided into pieces, where for example 40 actual bits mappable to it's position in regards to given value, must all contain the value for it to be set. In minor scale, while changes are appearing, they take effect rather collectively, singularly contributing to it: this is called Z effect, effect of coming.

And we turn outwards:
- Biggest infinities, in our life, are only represented by small bits of it, and then we say the bits are part of _infinity of the same content_, if not _infinity repetition of the same content_ as in _T_, if not _R_; this is measurable on statistical scale, and where the rule of this statistics is over it: it always takes effect, even changing the otherwise random distributions by some force; it get sure O, U or A value, where U is definite unknown, which one you can predict by sets of statistical values, and the expectation fit correctness. We do this using frequencies: for example, ["A", "U"] seems to logically fit that the second frequency is not U is first one is A, but it's O: but the case is that even if those are each excluding the other kinds of frequencies, there might be strong rule for A, but not U might not appear from metareasonation of the same particle: it does not purposefully alter to have the other bit O. Perhaps both are important, but one shadows the other in this sense: but finally, we get one too strongly or, many of them.

Digits of infinity:

Consider the number of 4 digits:
EEEE

While the inside gets it's limit in zero, we average the next smaller digit, so that if there is I, it would be E at it's smallest, and if there is E, it would be E at it's largest. Indeed, we can show E in other color or fix our calculation with that, and it's somehow involved: bit rather usually are not. For example, we have methods of rounding, which consider that part.

With infinity, it seems bigger hazzle: the letter "E" is the last, and also the length (R=E) and value (T=E) of this sequence, as clear as base-1 system with single repeated value. E^E could be an alternative, E in power E - representing this kind of valuewise, but especially in relation, which appears, and the powers and octaves of power symbol itself if not otherwise for you, where this might not be a computer language, but is actual math. Infinity to infinity power creates infinity square, and E being multidimensional is often meant to represent squares: it's _absolutely full_, the single line must represent the line times the line; and where E^E is supposed to be 4‚Å¥, thus 16, it's already true that this line could be. Sometimes, indeed, I use E^E = EE to use more power in number system, optimizing for small digits.

Now, this infinity in square: where values are already fractal, forming two dimensions on single line, as present in E-interpretation, while E itself contains this typically in linear fashion, among other things being multiplicity itself: it's form, then, while being inwards exponential, is linear as each expression contains exponential fact itself. Otherwise, I would be invisible: no digits for the opposite factor.

Now resolve infinity:
- In fractal outside, you can resolve the resolution of outer digit indefinitely.
- The higher infinities, while the numbers are changing, are rather locally static, or the change is visible, or the change is natural correction to our predictions; whichever paradox appears, appears in reality of this number: so by inducing kind of paradox view, stating that the bigger digits are static, but _in their own dimension_ they move with the same smooth like us: normally, we won't hit anything, and the effects are slow. So we can move in sense of those digits, being still normal cityzen locally, just as the wind can blow, moving atoms radically, but we as bodies won't move much by this: only feel the force.

Then, resolve the last digit: while local digit is less of fractal nature, you must *outwards* inverse or rather reverse it: you take number, which is square in size, and you find the next smaller digits where you fit four digits of what you now had, into box you had before. _In case the line is straight_, you don't fit many digits _to see it's direction to infinity_. For example, the _resolution of your number_ can need you to do 256*256 pixel resolution fill, and the subsequent pixel would not exist in your otherwise symmetric container! If if't the extreme value of itself, given all the proportions, it's V, the limit value.

Here: infinity has been mapped to 4 digits with local data. When we resolve those digits through math, we add information, but the symmetries of infinities are met perfectly in resulting calculation, where the number appears as one of more and more numbers, possibly attached together: but if the direction, as much precision / information it had, is now not correct, it had to be incorrectly informed or estimating or measuring it's current situation, which was not such actual fall or rise.
