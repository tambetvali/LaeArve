# Folders and Chapters

We read both md files and folders in common sequence, where one can link to the other.
- md file can have _headers_, which contain the "hidden" (in DHTML, not in Json source) property: __folder__: follow <foldername>. This means, folders are _Nested Documents_, which unlike _Subdocuments_, which create a given link rather to current position, they come _after_ all titles at the same level and their subtitles are included, but including the time-call-backs of folders, which are meant for properly future-seeing logic, where future is directed in "time" backwards, but it's so easy to catch this time inside a _closed system_ like a static view within it's static properties.
- Folders can either follow back the same name: if the sequence meets back, it just closes it's sequence worrylessly, and if it does not, the structure does not have to be big. It's uncommon to leave this _open_ whether the structure would link back, but then they are already like _outside structures_? But following back: one just _accepts to be equal_, and this creates _unidirectional value_. It's a structure with U on two frequencies: closing the value, they have position holding, that they represent a single entity.

- md files can have subdocuments, which are linked into it's tree: however, it needs inside-linking policy, where the total number of blocks they display is limited, and also the number of chapters visible in their content listing, so they want to show beginnings of a few chapters, in a few pages, and then the ultimate "Continue reading ->" with chapter title under it, in bold, and icon before if needed or available. This is an information block. There might be inside handmade "enter" type of links for specific chapters, where the author knows what exactly has direct linking inside. We don't automate so trivial thing: an user AI can do that as well, and the user is able to describe the Markdown input and output, but not the whole structure so easily, even to future AI's of common sense: unless a Word Appears :)

- md files can have nested documents, which appear right after the given chapter, thus at the end.

The following structure:

```
### ChapterName

## ChapterName
```

Where upper chapter has deeper level.

We connect it this way: the lower chapter will feed this structure to it's preceding block of higher level. Same level connects them as lists towards the receiver, where there are higher and lower levels than themselves.

The first title needs to be H1 title: if it has lower levels before, the "terminal effect" appears: this block is connected to the _last_ block of the file, creating a backwards circle, and in the beginning, one can _actually add their part of the summary_, where headers are still under the first title in the list, even if reached as last.

How this time-travel effect is achieved? This is programmatically a little bit complicated, but almost trivial when organizing the inner "hooks", which is a magic keyword of having some inner properties solved to higher level:
- When you add blocks you can have it unknown how the next chapter would appear, perhaps you are the _last_ list, but in the end of whole generation, where all the blocks are already defined: this can always happen before design block.
