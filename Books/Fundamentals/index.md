# Here comes the more fundamental structure of Laegna numbers

It's often represented in decimal system, being rather system-invariant and conditioned implementation of system basis.

The frequencer implementations, which are neutral to context of Laegna-specific conceptions, trying to dwelve into the specific problem set, not just the actual solution. Currenly, this could be used well as base layer of Laegna math, for simpler and non-optimized implementations, into the base system; optimized Laegna rather directly uses this, and does not give special advantage to subsystems like Ten or Den, where even advantages of other systems can be used in case of special solutions: for example, the memory needed to round decimal system to infinity might exist.
