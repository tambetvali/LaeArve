# ðŸ§  Feedback of chat histories

We should take the chat histories of our bot, convert into documentation and Q&A formats, summarize and do the other operations, and finally use it in their documentation and fine-tuning source.

There should be ways to edit this and to fix it, which should look like this:
- Upload your chat history to server, which might be your personal protected space somewhere or flask running privately in your computer, but it might be GitHub Hub.
- Processing scripts would work on it, giving it some time to be perceived.
- You would take the AI's initial answers and fix them based on the result, and write new Q&A cards based on the discussion, or add documents to follow in this context. You can add tags to relate this all: Prolog-syntax of relations are created between discussion, your responses, additional material etc.; as this can get complex, the allowed relations in your system are converted to more standard Prolog; given that the Prolog is compatible to actual implementation, you would also include the interlogic in your prolog. Where it's rather correct is the database: you can relate items in your databases based on Prolog, and use chapters, which generate Prolog queries to list the content from other pages: Markdown chapters would be copied based on Prolog output, or you would do it yourself.

Why to add them: GPT rather does have permanent memory if issues are logged and sucesses mentioned.

## GPT4All chat about "version 0.1"

GPT4All asked clarification about "what is version 0.1", stating it's unclear.

"version 0.1":
- if you see round numbers, they are most probably generalizations.
- This one is generalization of an "initial version"
- We use metaphors.

For example, if you see "version 0.1.123", it's more probably an actual version or a generalization of higher concept.

Version 0.1 - it's not _less probable_, statistically, to get symmetric numbers, and indeed you reach them in your versions unless you have some kind of 13-rule.

Anyway, it's _as probable_ to find numbers like 0, 1, or 1000000 in contexts, where they refer to either very small, or very big numbers, or other trivial aspect by which they are _unique_, being some of the most symmetric or simplest examples.

Thus, seeing some very simple or very beautiful numbers, such as "0.123456789", which almost definitely refers to something:
- Most probably, they represent a general case of such number.
- If format is _an example_, it often needs names like "John Smith" or IP addresses like 0.0.0.0, or webdomains like http://www.mywebdomain.ai/ - all of them might fake somebody, because really you can register just "mywebdomain", much like you can register "youtube", having nothing to do with "you".
