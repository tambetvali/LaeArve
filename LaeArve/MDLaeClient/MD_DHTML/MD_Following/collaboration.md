# Collaboration and Cooperation

Based on Licences like CC, collaboration is welcome. I won't really mind if somebody is selling some content on my site, given some interest of open source people.

## __Your Licence needs to apply if you assign content to my website__:
__Subtitle__: __Topic__: licence of Laegna Products by Tambet VÃ¤li.

__Licence for Trial-based Collaboration__: Your trial is not ending, and it provides one functional product with full features, such as minimalist model of chat with balanced features. While it might limit user base size, such as a team size for the user, it cannot be ignorant that it's functionality must make sense and be balanced with the intensity of appearance as well, where pure trials could be of interest as links, but they also have to take the effort to implement my standard again and guarantee that everything, including the idea, is in accordance of being a commercial partner; if they donate to public efforts, we might enjoy additional freedom of considering they know their place in business.

__Agile Freedom__: To be __Free__, the user has to be __Agile__: His first iterations won't cover, for example, using the advertising or donations or other source of income; they must include that the free software has virtual "iterations", for example 1st iteration is to provide 5MB space and a basic non-scientific calculator to work on the files; the 2nd iteration includes calculator for a programmer and 5.1MB of space. From now on the user can create their own iterations, for example paying for iterations 3-7, and they enjoy having them finished, while the programmer has uploaded calculations for MatLab, which would be enable in those interfaces as additional calculator model, and the user would *enable the use of additional megabytes*, which the user has virtually - to update the content, but for example it might be compressed in a zip and included in some 5 or 10MB content automatically; the user, still, is **guaranteed** to upload their full-version files and functionality in a whole, as if they were payd - but the use of this is not enabled, even if the trials might register one or two such accounts, and give additional days or 10 messages each month. The programmer, using a freeware clone of MatLab, has ensured that those are mostly rather compatible files, and collected feedback from friends with MatLab. So if the user or programmer pays, the ads can be disabled for some user base or specific user; if the programmer creates a donation page and registers at provider of more targeted advertising, it's minus if the common interface cannot be used to create a free community, advertising their own things and being able to pay for the service, for example given that the advertisement would pay 10 cents for given amount of use of the MatLab in cloud, for example; programmers would extend the first implementation and target better functionality inside the resources available, and thus the __Free__ company would: implement the standards or similar standards, whichever they might have proper access to, perhaps there are different licences and appearances, create a free product to their users; then, on our page, they could also support their advanced and paid functions, given that their page, book, and the amount of emphasis of it such as being on our main page or in a short list of rather unreachable page of certain type of external services, where they are rather called "toys", because we more or less ignore the commercial aspect in our attribution and refer only to features, which can be used incorporating our licence with similar or equal one; an user would accept to have part of content based on CC, and part based on GPL, for example they could disable GPL part for users, who want their commercial features implemented as other product.

__Freedom of Programmer__: The manager accounts the money, while programmer accounts the features and practical solutions, such as a self-driving car; for an engineer, the benefits happen in physics and logical circuits, and it's hard to have multiple benefits. So we need managers. Freedom of software, indeed, for a programmer it has some management features, such as being payd automatically ("free software"); otherwise it's a toy or a trial.

__Educational Needs__: Educational needs of the user and their bot or AI, given the equal understanding of educational needs and their application, and then the applicance of my interpretation to the licence, which allows the use in you bot knowledge bases and public knowledge bases, unless accomplied with disturbing or insulting context or legally incorrect context.
