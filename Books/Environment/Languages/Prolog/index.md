# Prolog

This is the language to run math and logic statements, which are then used with deductive processor of logic and mathematic: while in Isabelle you prove, here you actually use your proofs quite directly while interacting with your data.

It's hard to create programs here, because in this logic there is no time: logic simply holds or does not - so you need emulators of time, in one or another way, as a hack.
