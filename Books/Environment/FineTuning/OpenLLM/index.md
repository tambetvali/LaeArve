# OpenLLM

__OpenLLM__ is using _PyTorch_: as PyTorch is our standard, even if currently we don't use it directly (vs. TensorFlow, which is not standards-compliant so we cannot use it with our standards), we prefer libraries and tools, which utilize PyTorch: we can easily export functionality and create general scripts to be used as hooks, to involve our code into both OpenLLM and TorchTune in case it's worth it.

In VSCode, you can use terminal to install it with pip, or you can use system terminal: Python is a prerequisite, so first install python (in Linux, it's a default).
