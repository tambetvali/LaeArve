# Llama Models

Continue is the open model, which along with Ollama serves Llama and is able to provide it to VSCode plugins:
- _[Using Llama 3.1 with Continue](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/tutorials/llama3.1)_

These models, then, can assist with coding tasks and run in your IDE (integrated programming environment).

- _[OpenLLaMA: An Open Reproduction of LLaMA](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama)_
- __[Llama](https://www.llama.com/)__ - which is already open sourced on it's own.
