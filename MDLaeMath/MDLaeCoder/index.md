# Laegna Math Coder

Coder is a mathematical representation of a Programming Language, where it does not have initial input about syntax, code files and their library dependencies.

The interface for the Coder:
- Typical Programming IDE of It's Own Time
- One can modify structured approach to Data
- One can assign execution tracks to Data, based on it's Syntax and Semantics

I use many capitals because the introduction part is itself Capital: it's where the _main cityzens_ (view "cityzen" in programming context from dictionary, especially figure out what means "major cityzen" or "junior cityzen", or then a "thief" in programming context of data and it's execution tracks, including the feedback to the execution tracks into trial and error: Based on [Theorem of Incompletness][1]).

[1]: TheoremOfIncompletness - That the Existence is Incomplete. Redirects to Theorem of Imperfection.
