I describe the mascott of Laegna, it's symbol and logo.

## Logo of Laegna

It's a reddish brown, wide and correct text "Laegna", which resembles a little bit some wooden work.

## Mascott of Laegna

This is a cat I call "Elise". She is the mathematician of the Universe, the base mathematics itself - something Laegna is about to reach.

## Symbol of Laegna

It's the I Ching symbol:
* Large black area is colored red instead, representing the Negotion. It's color of danger.
* Large white area is colored green instead, representing the Position. It's color of peace.
* Small black circle is colored yellow instead, representing the Posetion. It's color, which is to blue as red is to green.
* Small white area is colored blue instead, representing the Negation. It's the color of corporations, which are related to doing annoying things, not living free and let-go life.

These are the colors of Laegna, the four base colors.
