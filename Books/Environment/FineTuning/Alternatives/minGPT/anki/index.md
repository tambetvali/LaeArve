= Anki cards

While this is not a necessity of our tools, I would prefer to include Anki cards and their support - users can work with the data output and edit it more efficiently, with a visual display.

== Workflow to Build the Trainer

To create a small trainer for minGPT that works with Anki cards using the genanki library:

1. Load Anki Cards:
   - Use the genanki library to load Anki cards from your `.apkg` deck file.
   - Extract the "Front" (question or input) and "Back" (answer or output) fields.

2. Convert and Save Temporarily:
   - Preprocess the extracted data into input-output pairs suitable for fine-tuning a GPT model.
   - Save the processed data in a hidden temporary folder using Python's `tempfile` module to simplify cleanup.

3. Train minGPT:
   - Update the training script in minGPT to load the data from the temporary file.
   - Use the prepared dataset to train the model on your Anki card content.

== Example Implementation

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python script to get you started:

```python
import genanki
import tempfile
import os

# Function to convert Anki cards
def extract_anki_data(deck_path):
    # Load your Anki deck
    anki_deck = genanki.Package(deck_path)
    notes = anki_deck.get_notes()

    # Process cards (Front -> Back)
    data = []
    for note in notes:
        front = note.fields[0]  # Front of the card
        back = note.fields[1]  # Back of the card
        data.append((front, back))
    
    return data

# Function to save data to temporary files
def save_to_temp(data):
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    temp_file = os.path.join(temp_dir, "anki_data.txt")
    
    with open(temp_file, "w") as f:
        for front, back in data:
            f.write(f"{front}\t{back}\n")
    
    return temp_file

# Load Anki deck and process
deck_path = "your_deck.apkg"  # Replace with your Anki deck path
anki_data = extract_anki_data(deck_path)

# Save processed data to temporary file
temp_file_path = save_to_temp(anki_data)
print(f"Data saved to temporary file: {temp_file_path}")

# Integrate with minGPT (modify your training script to load the temp file)
```

== Features of the Script:

Additional Features:
- Automated Temporary Files: The script saves the preprocessed data in a temporary location, which is hidden and automatically managed.
- Streamlined Workflow: Loading Anki cards, processing them, and training minGPT is streamlined for efficiency.

This approach allows you to integrate Anki-based learning data into minGPT effortlessly, with the flexibility to clean up temporary files after use.
