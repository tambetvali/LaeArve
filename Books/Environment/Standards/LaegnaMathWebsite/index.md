# Extensions to Standards

We seamlessly integrate some extensions to standards - for example, using Markdown for many purposes.

With Markdown we rather continue it's general design for an application on our web system:
- E-mail looking solution, for example we use lines before the first title as headers, as in e-mail.
- When we develop a feature, when Markdown is not preprocessed by us, it would look like expressive Markdown for the given syntax.
