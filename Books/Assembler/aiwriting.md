# ðŸ—¿ AI training with input functions

a = ai.prompt("Question").

When this returns the answer,

@ai.prompt("Question") = a.

This applies the answer to this question. "@" is the variable operator, which shows which ones are variables: either model (in this case, which is also a function by our matters), the prompt (you could keep the model and change the prompt function to have this answer) or the question, which in this case cannot be variable so perhaps, as "ai" is the second variable candidate, "@" could be omit: usually it's omit, if you want to change variables and not function, or function with constant input and no variables around.

You can change specific value and this is why we have not variable as input, but a literal constant. We apply the value for the function or model only for this specific input.

We don't need to generalize to the end, everything we can choose:
- Expressions that ai is generatively optimized.
- Expressions about whether we use AI model or simple matrix or put the values into a dictionary with input and output.
- Whether we delay this and for example, send our patches to the model introducers.

Instead, the case itself that we mathematically apply new value to a function:
- This is mathematically simple way to express AI calculations.

AI, from matrices, integers and tables, differs from:
- Precision
- Generalization
- Time-bound optimization

Given all this, we can still express most AI in terms of such simple expressions, and when we switch model, it's implementation and real functions, which might back it up: we have a common way to express math and AI goals, and to convert and refactor between them; for example given mathematical solution would determine correct function based on given set of input-output pairs, where it must know the function class and combinatorics to solve it. AI could provide, instead, estimations: mathematically, in both cases you are giving values to functions.

This is API and the actual activist behind this, be it logical system, imperative command or AI or user himself, can be more hidden and less standardized, but to keep it's goals, such intermediate format is needed to express, what is actually done. Indeed, for some classes, perfect models can be developed.
