# Organization of these Documents

This is organized into three folders:
- LaeArve: the System itself; Laegna Math Webpage is able to teach AIs.
- Books: the website content, AI and human studies are organized into books.
- History: historic versions
  - History/Laegna: some interesting information.

Meaning of this division:
- To add these Documents to AI document database, while it's impossible to select multiple folders and unreasonable to have multiple documentation items for the same site; it's extremely slow to index everything, on my computer: to add them separately means that embedding updates and initial indexing and embedding is quite fast.
- Perhaps, also, these are naturally the top-level folders.
- This structure is reflected, then, also on the website for the same reasons.
