## Operator priotity

Order of operators is free.

## Componentwise operation

Multiplication, for example, will make the number *bigger* in regards to both components: it must hold through all distortions of space as the same operator, not creating oppositions. We use 1/4 rule of the number space: downwards, we find them in 1/4 coordinate system transformations, where they are locally linear.
- For example: 1^infinity, 1 in power of infinity, is then 2. This is that infinity needs to be added _in subscript before the number_ and _reversed to minus infinity at the same time_, to get (-inf)sqrt(1) to be zero - the Laegna operation is similar to square root (remember infinity is 2 and we can count positively downwards).
  - The case is that by 12 typical positions around the number we move it around in the frequential space, which can grow and shrink in both sides: we are rather mathospace oracles who can move around time and space, not come in one, and go into other direction. Variables, in our operations, interact without our knowledge or effort - so we have OA time of this logical space movements and IE time in real time, and OA time when zoomed consists of it's changes in operations, and complete changes.
