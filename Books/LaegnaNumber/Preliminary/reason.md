# Why to have this

Because an AI told me that rather, creative set of Q & A is necessary, than autogenerated one.

To make it somehow simple:
- The process would generate 4 apples + 3 apples = 7 apples, but in Laegna numbers.
- It would also generate Latin equivalent, as the one given here.
- From given cards, it would search for "apples" and "apples" somehow added, so that 4 and 3 would give 7; it extracts a compatible task and replaces the numbers with intermediate numbers.
- With "minus 1" being a simplest operation, and reversal of digits in existence of minus is also combinatorically trivial, where only one simple table is needed to replace: the resulting system allows to contemplate on mathematical properties of it.

If in Laegna system, of 4 values of digit, 4-digit words are then ideal.
- In decimal system, thus it's proper to mark infinity with: ten digits (with this resonance of full-scale number frequency).
- In 3*3 mode, let's use two linearized systems, or it's rather 9*9 module and corresponding exponents.
- In Laegna 2*2, the exponents grow fast into themselves, and multiplication forms timelines, which are finally equal to square waves: this is contained equally in numbers.

Laegna number:
IIII EEEE IIII EEEE

It is 16-square, and has several dimensions. Measured from I to E, it does this twice (this is typical assumption for this format). Somehow, this half-octave frequency, powers less than octave, symmetrically reflects it's properties in 1/2 scale. But to 4-digit infinity, it also projects square space: those spaces, where number is rather long string stretched at any point, but each point has R equal to the whole, and projects this into I and E of it's axe, from inside. The R value is equal to movement of this point in regards to change in R, so for example it can learn to be direction-equivalent.

Where we have equivalency in order of writing plus, minus, multiplication and division in same sentence: we include both +- and */ in the same matrix cell, where they behave invariantly and symmetrically when our method is applied over all matrix calculation.

Each digit has R and T:
- Lower bound: -R reflects the scope of R with minus, area right before zero point, as expressible by Laegna numbers; here is the lowest number this digit can contain.
- Digit value: the number inside the digit, an instance. This can be reflected in Table of Digits, where their content can be processed in regards to having key or access to it's type, in regard to single initialization or publishment or linked copy or backlink to some public card.
- Higher bound: +R reflects the highest number of the range of the digit.
- Approximator: optionally, this can be reflected through a calculation of the axe, where the digit is somehow centered and upheaded.

Z digits: In calculations, digit space is measured. Each digit in such range usually has common format, such as O and A for base-2, I, O, A, E in base-4, adding U and/or V in base-3 and base-5 and base-6. U can be separate digit in beginning, or the number is _in the middle of number block_, such as 0.5, 1.5 etc., being approximation of the value averages of this digit, like inline-U. In such case, it reminds more a logical system. I and E in one-digit divisor group after comma or dot or where the letters are decapitalized; moving digit space to subunit precision: this also reflects that you add small letters in the middle of the number.
- Large number digits have formats such as {ae} is the digit number ae, where {ii:ae:ee} can specify the lower and upper bounds of the digit.
- All calculation rules are applied, in zero-dimensional digit they must _still happen_, because despite far below zero, the _axes are symmetric to higher dimension_, where they are defined. So we make some use of subatomic world even in case we won't understand it: mistake or not?
- We have also one trivial latin Decimal system for multidimensional numbers with high digit ranges.

When the high and low octave numbers are compared:
- When the small numbers have less containment, they also have less digits.
- As many calculations are needed to have infinite number of digits mixed into the same number: but the digits are symmetric to space in _small_ version, such being numbers far down in the fractal.
- In higher dimensions, higher fractal views appear: rather the _classes_ are visible, and the fractals appear based on symmetry, to make sume use in those scopes: otherwise, they would not _approach an ideal_.

X digits: Outer digit space measures the length of a number, possibly surrounded by other numbers.

Y digits: space-separated numbers form the next dimension; lines can add frequencies, where each digit is 1/4 degrees up by frequency, thus still having the multidimensional generalization: where you use 1/4 rules, 14-58 separation, to see the 4-dimensional space expansion, and through octave shift of 4 octaves down or up (it's symmetric) you would reach linearized scale. The infinity axe is smooth in terms that it relates to smooth reality, so the infinity potential shifts around. Thus, Z and Y are the _space_ dimensions, while X is _inside time_ - without notion to our specific time, we give no specific meaning to it, while everybody would understand the general future and the past from history and reality, especially their archetypes, which tend to repeat or seem repeated.

But let's have one initiative, which reasons preliminary:
- To have very Latin-resembling version of Laegna study cards for an AI.
- To have it generalize those patterns _in advance_ before learning Laegna system, and in _mixed pattern_ with it and preferably it's original source: step-by-step, trivially the Latin numbers are converted to resemble the basic symmetries of Laegna, which are repeated in whole numbers and small numbers.
- Then, to be able to carry the AI analysis to repeat the research.
  - Some research papers, especially for oscillations, frequencies etc., might be important tautological relations, but appear to repeat the same number digit combination in oscillations. This is the behaviour of frequential system to show oscillations that way, where they can become or seem deeper and more organized, and the words and terminology might simplify.
  - In mixed studies, especially showing the form (digit representation) and content (the number) in different conditions, even teaching it combination by combination that direct use of latin letters instead of classical decimal system is rather meaningless, but not in compression algorithms, which might take advantage of digits.

We have dynamic digital system:
Z: digit range is allowed for it's value: minimum, real, maximum is given
X: each digit is having the content size, and when the number flows in Laegna system, given the digit number and content, and even acceptin incertanties when meeting partial digits to projections (they measure the statistical appearance of values, where calculator test must confirm real gaussian distribution, even to far extremes where very improbable values appear in very long time, or in small parts of it). Digits, here, can be any size. On X, digits can have frequential space: same digit on upper and downer line (higher and lower: I generalized to Laegna and added some emphasis perhaps to the actual value of better and worse where "down" reminds of "downer", but in math this is non-emotional strict attitude to the emotion and it's combinatorics, where it's e-motion, motion in ie range, and Life is just an example of this range, but each member is then an example of life [reasoning space time]); so digits can have left and right components to higher and lower infinity zone, and V component for the movement of 1/2 as opposed to rest of 1/2 already contained in the number, of 1/4 conversation things do: for example, from zero to infinity, around one, is 1/4 transformation of insinity scale in terms as how much a number is bigger or smaller than it's square. But adding two members of same size, property of another position axe: and rather, it grows _smaller_, where as ideals converge to higher ideals, but adding two numbers still converges to _one digit_ in this U-expanding space, where you put the center rather higher: you measure in higher frequency.

Frequencies:
Scale of each value of a digit, where you can have frequential digits with frequencies of one digit covering the same size as your matrix space, where the encoding should only contain "E"'s, perhaps "I"'s: inside and outside, it grows in range. Where two digits meet, for example frequency which is counted by 100 gradian steps (1/4) and number value, lower dimension also counted in such, and finally Z: the dimension, which is counted by some of such values, but normally a _development value_ of such is counted in these, where reality can _buy with time_.

For example, Ten, system of possible Logecs values, is four letters:
I, O, A, E

The frequencer, then, has 4 positions. Each is the same-dimensional value and represented, again, by the same dimensionality (R) and digit value (T) matrix of either operations or truth values, with one additional Vector representing the transformation of one, which is actually vector matrix: it has 4/1 expansion, as the square matrix or mult/div operations, where you iterate in two dimensions all the parts as in matrix, and the value projection goes down towards i in the same space.

You separate:
- Half of conditionals read OA space, write IE space
- Half of conditionals read IE space, write OA space
- You use Dens, and Strings _expand_ the digit Dens: Den of a String is combination of Dens with same name, with some digits unknown "\_"-digit or space in simpler numbers, representing -1 or O-odd[with U, even is without U]-octave OUA number U; for example for three digits with Den.H, string has three-digit Den.H counterpart, and some operations especially of higher age can be done here: digits are reordered so that their arrangement is subvalue, and inner arrangement maps upwards, and this can be perfectionized as fractal for complex values, where index tables can be spread in files and databases or AI models of approximation.

Two conditionals exist, such as "past" and "future", to be preceded by if; also the "now" can exist, where the frequential conditions, along with frequential zones and attachments of testers are used.

As well, the frequency rules can be changed: for example in deduction, if all the parameters except one are false, that one must be true even if unknown; in induction it's the opposite: if three are uknown, the fourth might be unknown, too, we accord positively for this positive statement.

_statement itself_ contains sinus: approaching possibly to a thing, we have to pass the "positive" statement of involving it, but this is complex logic in lower frequency: we live through and purify our emotions, thus also the mathematical space where it resists.
