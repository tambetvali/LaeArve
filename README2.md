# Philosophy of Laegna Math Project

## Subsequent work

I am going to add here links to specific projects for this project: while they become distinct tools for different purposes, they will be included here as one project with more compact code. This way, it's kind of Lego. It's maybe not a "philosophy", but it's how we follow the iterative philosophy to divide it into parts.

## Iterative philosophy

I am doing this iteratively:

Iteration tree 1, development of idea:
1. I implement rough estimation of idea in more perfect forms. As an AI is advancing, it would perhaps also advance in implementing an idea:
   - We try to keep this open to AI developments, so that we express even the most long-termed ideas; once the future is here, the projects would learn to apply those ideas. For example, you could generalize user interface and rather give your essential math.
   - This is a development website, where I aim to build support for AI fine-tuning and creation of lessons to learn Laegna, my conception of Mathematics, Logic and much more. I also might develop more general scopes, where the work can be applied to introduce other sciences or bring them closer to Laegna axiomatic basis. I hope my proofs help you to prove certain aspects of your theory.
2. Possibility for DIY:
   - The idea list covered here will give you enough possibilities for DIY. I am kind of simplistic after all those years, and generally use one simpler kind of library, the most basic standards, languages and tools such as well-developed interfaces, and I try to find such forms for my ideas, that with help of an AI, they could be separately implemented often with not too many lines of task and refactorings and validatings of code, a work which could be now done programmers and non-programmers, while programmers would also produce human-verified, quality code and API structures, where the users could learn API structures without learning programming: for example, an API with commands for basic math, such as "add", would be more or less understandable to person with basic math knowledge and linguistic basis, to express a + b with add(a, b) is not so hard to understand, while the complex little structures inside a function, where they tend to go on, would be a complexity even for a programmer, for basic first weeks of much of the code, where we would not understand some code at all by realistic optimization.
3. Separate implementations of different parts
   - I rather create subsequent projects here in Git, where I implement the components separately: server and client, the Laegna math subsystem, and for example filetree transformations which should give solid basis for other components to use projected file tree.
   - While I am describing here in this site in advance, and creating the most customized and advanced collection of Laegna tools, I create more general-purpose Git repositories, where I develop basic products, using the same Licence ([CC](README3.md)).
4. Subsequent mergings to this project
   - I am going to take my custom libraries, add classes more together into a few files (navigating in Explorer should be as simple as navigating inside files, where we don't want long content indexes; rather we have tradeoffs than rules). All the used .py files must be in LaeArve root folder, while inside specific folders there are rather examples, and even non-working examples: rather this is illustrative code, and I often check out what can be produced by an AI with given task.
