# Laegna in relation to philosophy

Logic with four truth values, as compared to two, can be seen as being "beyond good and bad". Nietzche has this concept, and also Buddha - we cannot judge life based on binary truth, but on something more complex. The obvious change from Yes and False is to Laegna logecs, where one can assign specific letters and try, whether they can do logical operations with elements of Buddhism or Taoism?

Laegna Truth Values form a clear tables and operations, unlike the concepts I mention here. Still, they can be interesting to compare.

## Intuitive Laegna

In life, we often use "yes" and "no" intuitively, without any particular logic. Intuitive use of Laegna would use the letters perhaps outside of the logecal tables, but they can consistently make sure, which conceptions of Buddhism or Taoism would get the "O" and "E" letters, being outside the scope of Logic. For this, I made a translation of the Truth Value Tables, which can be found in I Ching and Taoist works - they both have four Truth values, which are well described.

## Laegna Taoism

Symbol of Tao consists of Four Truth Values:
* Good: This is Position in Laegna.
* Good in bad: This is Negation in Laegna.
* Bad: This is Negotion in Laegna.
* Bad in Good: This is Negation in Laegna.

We see that with binary truth values, we won't do any scientific work about Taoist principles - still, we can often meet them in life. We could try to research the tautologies with Laegna Truth Tables.

Each part of Tao symbol consists of 1 Ten in Laegna.

## Laegna I Ching

It has lines with binary values either remaining as-is or changing to their opposites. For system of Laegna, those appear as being well-defined values, despite the rest of the text being more metaphorical or philosophical:
* Yang: Position.
* Yang => Yin: Posetion.
* Yin: Negotion.
* Yin => Yang: Negation.

When talking about changes in life, we would use those symbols. One can think, whether combinations of Laegna Truth Values would really give us the base elements of Cosmos - if those represent the natural forces and their changes, indeed a Hexagram of I Ching would consist of 6 Tens in Laegna.
