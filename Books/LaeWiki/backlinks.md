# Backlinks in Wiki

Wikipage, which contains changes to original text, or selective changes such as some part and the change, should be able to backlink to contain the change in original page or update visible from the original page.

Wikipage, which contains some additional cards, like Questions for the Answers in pages, should be able to backlink to contain this in hidden metadata of each chapter, or in box after each chapter or turning the chapter into Q&A pairs. This can be merged to original page or create additional subpage / page.
