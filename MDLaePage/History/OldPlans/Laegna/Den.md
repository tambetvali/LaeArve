# Dens

Den is the primary digit, bit in Laegna Assembler.

It's defined as:

Den "d" = value.

Where quotation marks define a new symbol into symbolic table, declared that variable to be used as such from now on.

Effectively, when this is a logical assembler, it will get a dimension of Time - each time a change occurs in Space, when it's finished, a change also occurs in Time.

Den has five basic values:

Execution track:
OI - what is wrong in the past, is wrong in the future
AE - what is correct in the past, is correct in the future
OE - what is wrong in the past, is correct in the future
AI - what is correct in the past, is wrong in the future
Moving in future direction, one will access only the values I and E.
Moving in future direction, one will access only the values O and A.
In both directions, one will access the values True and False. It will compare those values with the intented direction, and when getting as input the potential values in the other direction in time, 

Where I use "U" to represent statistical dimension in Laegna Language, which I made to invent a set of mathematical and logical ideas into a language, possibly to fit many languages to a certain degree.

## Dimensions of execution

As a basic logical unit of Laegna Logex, Dens implement a basic logical functionality.

Automata:

Each of them has an automate. This connects conclusion from the last state to execution of the next state in respect to all basic logical values this operator can have. Other operators will execute all their constructs with respect to each of those values, and the automate would choose, whether to accept those states. Each of the state is meant to be permanent execution track of this value, where it's chosen setting is converted to it's actual return.

## Index

One dimension is dimensionality:
* Inside, for each square, a matrix is composed.
* Other objects can use this matrix in regards to their conditions.
