I am trying to see whether Continue is going to produce what will be our code page server for python, the way we would show ".py" files to the user.

We parse:

```python
#
# Comments, which start at beginning of line, except the ones directly
# preceding the code block without
# empty block between, are considered
# Markdown content, and when there are
# blank lines between those comments,
# the Markdown paragraphs would be
# separated by one empty line for all
# those empty lines in code, or two
# if they are many (to stylize).
#
```

Code, normally, is then displayed in python code blocks. If you copy each block and paste into your file, you
won't get any documentation: if you download it, you get it in your ".py" file (__Python file__:).

Notice: AI should detect I referred to whole chapter, and the navigation tree implemented with Anytree should provide such navigation features to the server; where we can have service provider in Flask.
